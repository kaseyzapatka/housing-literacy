_This section describes widow guards._  

A `window guard` is a device that can be attached to a window to prevent young children from falling. Often a window guards prevents the window from fully opening in some way.

Landlords in New York City have an obligation to install window guards on all windows except those giving access to fire escapes when children under 10 years of age are present in the household (meaning they live there). Tenants have to notify the landlord if a child under 10 is present and landlords must provide tenants with a form to request installation. Once installed, the tenant must not tamper with or remove.
