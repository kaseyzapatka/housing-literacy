_Item 27 discusses how matters pertaining legal disputes over this lease will be decided by a judge and not a jury. However, this does not prevent either the tenant or the landlord from seeking a jury trial regarding personal injury or property damage._

This section in the lease waives the right to a jury trial for either party in legal disputes related to this lease. In other words, both parties waive the right to a jury trial if there is a dispute over any section of this lease. This means that any dispute about elements of this lease will be heard and decided by a judge, in what is called a bench trial.

This does not, however, waive the rights of either the landlord or the tenant to a jury trial by if they wish to bring a lawsuit for anything else. In other words, the lease can only waive the right of both parties to request a jury trial in lawsuits that dispute interpretations of the lease, nothing else.
