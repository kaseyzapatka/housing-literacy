_Item 16 discusses how tenants can assign a lease._


The `primary resident` is the tenant whose name is on the lease. When they assign the lease to another, they transfer the entire interest of the unit to someone else and permanently leave the unit. This means they have no future rights, interests, or claims to the unit. Essentially, they are giving up the apartment

This can only be done with the written consent of the landlord, who may refuse for any reason or no reason at all. If the landlord's refusal is found to be unreasonable, the tenant is entitled to be released within 30 days of the date from which the request was originally submitted to the landlord.
