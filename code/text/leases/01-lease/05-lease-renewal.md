_This section describes the process of renewing a lease in a rent-stabilized unit._

Non-rent-regulated tenants have fewer rights and protections than do tenants living in a rent-regulated unit.

**Lease Renewal Obligations: Non-Rent-Regulated vs Rent-Regulated.** Landlords of renters living in a `non-rent-regulated apartment` must agree to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. If they decide not to, the tenant must leave when the lease expires or face eviction. However, leases do sometimes contain automatic renewal clauses. In this case, landlords must notify tenants an additional 15-30 days in advance of the deadline that the tenants have to notify the landlord of their intent to not renew the lease. In other words, if the lease contains an automatic renewal clause, the landlord must give the tenant an extra 15-30 daysâ€™ notice.

Landlords of renters living in a `rent-regulated apartment` are obligated by law to give tenants the option to renew their lease, either for one year or two. This is one of the most powerful rights that rent-regulated tenants have. There are some exceptions, like if the landlord can demonstrate that the tenant does not use the unit as their primary residence or they have violated the lease in some way. However, generally tenants are given the option to renew the lease under the same terms `UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE LAW.` Any rent increases must follow the legal allowable increases specified by the rent guidelines boards `EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE TENANT HAS A PREFERENTIAL RENT.`

`IF A TENANT IS PAYING LESS THAN THE LEGAL RENT, THE TENANT MAY FACE A RENT INCREASE HIGHER THAN THE RENT GUIDELINES BOARD INCREASE. IN FACT, THE LANDLORD MAY RAISE THE RENT UP TO THE LEGAL RENT, EVEN IT THAT INCREASE IS HIGHER THAN THE RENT GUIDELINES BOARD INCREASE.`

A [History of Allowable Rent Increases Chart through 2018](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) can be found online.

The landlord must give the tenant written notice of their right to renew between 150 and 90 days of the expiration of the lease. The tenant has 60 days from when they were given the notice to renew. If the tenant does not accept, the landlord can seek eviction proceedings. If the tenant accepts, the landlord has 30 days to return the signed lease.

Once you have signed the lease renewal, the lease is considered to be binding, and you should pay the appropriate increase when the current lease expires, whether or not the landlord returns a copy of the lease after they have signed it. If a copy of the signed lease is not returned, you should contact your land about providing you a copy or lodge a complaint with 311.

**Important Considerations.** If you have any questions, you should consult a lawyer because there are a number of exceptions.

1. If you have not received a lease renewal from the landlord, it is recommended that you contact the landlord immediately, ask for a lease, and notify them of YOUR desire to stay.

	Additionally, if you have not received the lease renewal during the proper time frame (90 to 150 days before the end of the lease), it is recommended that you contact the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is the state agency that administers rent regulations. They can be reached at (718) 739-6400. You should also fill out [Tenant's Complaint of Owner's Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease](https://rent.hcr.ny.gov/RentConnect/Tenant/leaseViolationOverview), which will walk you through the process that can be completed online.

	Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary.

2. Since, the landlord of a rent-stabilized apartment has the right to evict a tenant that did not return the lease renew option within 60 days of receiving it, it is important to return your lease renewal promptly. However, if the landlord was late in sending the tenant the lease renewal (they did not send the lease renewal between 150 and 90 days before the end of the lease), that fact can be used in tenant's defense if eviction proceedings are initiated by the landlord.
