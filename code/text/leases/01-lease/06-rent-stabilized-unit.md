_This section discusses the difference between a rent-stabilized and a non-rent-stabilized unit._

A building may be rent-stabilized if it was:

- built before 1974,
- has 6 or more units,
- and has a legal current rent less than $2,774.76, as of January 1, 2019.

`Be aware that certain units that have received government assistance through subsidies or tax credits, may have still be rent-stabilized apartments even if the rent is more than $2,774.76. For an example, see the discussion of 421-a tax credits below.`

With the Rent Law of 2015, the Deregulation Rent Threshold (DRT) was increased to $2,700, but has increased to $22,774.76 as of January 1, 2019. It increases each year in accordance with the 1-Year lease increases as approved by the Rent Guidelines Board. `Be sure to check the current DTR.` If your apartment qualifies, make sure to ask your landlord if your apartment is rent-stabilized at lease signing.

**Example of How the Deregulation Rent Threshold is Usually Calculated:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> Prior to 2019, the DRT was $2,700.00. The 1-year allowable increase on the leases was 1.25% for leases starting between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018. 1.25% of $2,700.00 is $33.75, which means that the DRT increased from $2,700.00 to $2,733.75 as of January 1, 2018. 

  $2,700.00  x 1.25% = $33.75

  $33.75 + $2,700.00  =  $2,733.75

The dereguation threshold was then increased from $2,773.75 to $2,774.76 as of January 1, 2019 because the 1-year allowable increase was 1.5% for leases starting between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019.

  $2,733.75  x 1.5% = $41.00

  $41.00 + $2,733.75  =  $2,774.76

**421-a.** Rent-regulated units can be stabilized for several reasons. One of the most common is the 421-a tax abatement program. For newly constructed units built after July 3, 1984, landlords can apply for a 421-a tax abatement if they construct new units, so long as they make them rent-stabilized. When the tax abatement period expires, so does the unit’s rent-regulated status, as long as there were proper notifications on the original lease and all lease renewals. However, if your lease extends beyond the date when abatements expire, deregulation takes effect when the last lease that was signed expires. Check the Rent Guidelines Board’s website for more information on [tax abatements and 421-a](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/tax-abatement-exemption-programs.page), read the [Fact Sheet #41](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/factsheet41taxabatements.pdf) for more information, and consult a housing lawyer if you have any legal questions.  

You can check your address to see if your building has been registered with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) using the [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) While this is a good method, however, keep in mind that the website may not always be accurate because of how that information is gathered and the process by which units are deregulated. Just because a building has regulated units, does not mean that all the units in the building are rent-regulated.

**Rent History.** That is why it is a good idea to check your unit’s rent history, since rent regulation status will be filed there every year. You have the right to know if your apartment unit is stabilized and are entitled to the benefits that accompany rent regulation. You can always verify your unit's rent regulation status by checking with the DHCR. They can be reached at `(718)739-6400` or you can contact your [local DHCR office](https://hcr.ny.gov/contact-us).

Also, you can request your rent history, which should tell you if you are rent stabilized. Simply fill out the [Online Contact Form](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask) and the DHCR will send that unit’s rent history to the unit’s address. The [Tenant Protection Unit's website](https://hcr.ny.gov/tenant-protection-unit) will walk you through the various options for requesting a rent history. However, the  online contact form is the easiest method.
