_This section discusses the “pet clause” and the conditions in which it can be waived._

Tenants may keep pets in their unit unless other specified against doing so in their lease. Landlords can evict tenants who violate their lease by having a pet if the lease specifies that they cannot.

However, in New York City and Westchester County, the no-pet clause is waived if it can be demonstrated that the tenant accused of violating their lease has _openly and notoriously_ kept a pet and the landlord or their agent's (like a super or someone from a management company) knew about it for more than three months.

Some **examples** of _openly and notoriously_:
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;">

- the tenant taking their dog for a walk  
- the super entered the apartment for repair and saw the pet or evidence of a pet like a lease or a litter box.
</blockquote>  
Additionally, tenants who may have disabilities may also ask for service animals or emotional support animals.
