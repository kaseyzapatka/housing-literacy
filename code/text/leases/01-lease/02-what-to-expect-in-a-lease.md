_This section gives an overview of what tenants should expect in a lease._

The initial lease that a landlord uses does not have to necessarily look exactly like the lease annotated here (However, the [Rent-Stabilized Renewal Lease Form](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/rtp8.pdf) and the [Rent-Stabilized Rider](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/ralr1.pdf) do have to look similar to the ones annotated here. See below for copies). In fact, with some exceptions (see below), landlords may rent to someone on any terms as long as they are agreed upon by both parties. While landlords are free to write their own leases; however, they must include some basic things. Therefore, when reading a lease there are a few things that are important to look for in a lease. The lease should:   

- use common words that have clear meanings
- be clear and coherent
- have sections large enough to read
- identify the unit that will be rented and its location
- name the parties (who is the landlord and who is the tenant)
- state the addresses of each party
- state the amount of rent and when it is due
- specify the length of the lease
- state the rights and obligations of each party involved

Also, any changes made to the lease should be initialed by both parties.  

**Illegal Provisions.** There are certain sections that are not legally binding or enforceable, even if agreed on by both parties. So, if a landlord includes them in the lease, they aren’t enforceable. Some examples include:

1.	Any language that waves a tenant's right to a trial by jury for anything other than the terms of the lease. Generally, leases waive the right to a trial by jury about any lawsuit between the landlord and the tenant regarding the lease. In other words, the lease can only waive the right of both parties to request a jury trial in lawsuits that dispute interpretations of the lease, nothing else.

2.	Any language that requires the tenant to pledge their furniture as security for rent. It is common for landlords to ask tenants for a security deposit to hold the unit, usually equal to a month's rent. The landlord cannot ask the tenant to pledge their furniture instead.

3.	Any language that exempts the landlord from responsibility for injuries or property caused by either the landlord’s negligence or the negligence of the landlord’s agent or employee (like a super or someone from a management company). In other words, the landlord is responsible for any damage to you or your property if the cause is a result of their carelessness or failure to fix something.   

Be sure to discuss any of these issues with a lawyer. For more information, see [page 3 of Tenants Right’s Guide](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf).
