_Item 13 discusses what tenants can expect in terms of heating services._

There are specific requirements as to when the landlord must provide heating services. The months between `October 1 and May 31` are considered heating season.

- If between `6am and 10pm` the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature inside the apartment must be 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Between `10pm and 6am` regardless of the temperature outside, the unit must be heated to at least 62 degrees Fahrenheit.
- If the tenant is paying for their own heating, they have the right to request a summary of the landlord's past two years of bill payment for heating. This, however, is very rare in NYC.
