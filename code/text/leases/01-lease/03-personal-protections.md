_This section outlines some personal protections of rent-regulated tenant._

Tenants have several protections that are designed to protect them individually. Here is a list of some of them:

**The Right to Organize.** Tenants have a right to organize, and a landlord cannot prevent them from doing so in any way. In fact, landlord must allow any tenant organization access to any common space in the building for meeting purposes, and cannot charge them a fee. Tenant meetings just need to take place at reasonable hours and be peaceful.

**The Right to Privacy.** Tenants have a right to privacy in their apartments. However, under certain conditions, the **landlord has the right to enter the apartment** if they provide reasonable notice, do so during a reasonable hour, and have the tenant's consent. If the tenant unreasonably denies entry into the apartment, the landlord can seek a court order that will allow them to enter. In cases of emergency, such as a fire, water leak, or life-threatening emergency, the landlord may enter without prior consent or notice.


**The Right to Freedom from Harassment and Retaliation.** `Harassment:`Landlords cannot harass tenants who exercise their rights. Harassment can take many forms:
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> physical or verbal abuse, denial of services, or multiple instances of nonsensical litigation. If a landlord lies or deliberately misrepresents the law to a tenant, this may also constitute harassment.
</blockquote>

Tenants who have been the subject of harassment should contact the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Landlords found guilty of harassment are potentially subject to fines.

`Retaliation:`Landlords cannot retaliate against tenants who exercise their rights.

<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> Some examples of retaliation might include a landlord trying to evict a tenant who is a part of a tenant’s rights organization or who has filed legitimate complaints against the landlord. Another common example is shutting off utilities are hot water, even though doing so is illegal.
</blockquote>

If a tenant suspects they are the victim of retaliation, they may be able to collect monetary damages from the landlord and should consult a lawyer.

**Personal Accommodation for Disabilities.** Landlords are required to make specific, yet reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities. A `reasonable accommodation` is considered a change in policy or rules associated with the lease that is not unreasonably expensive for the landlord, depending on how much the landlord can afford.

<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> For example, allowing a tenant to have a guide dog despite a “no pets” policy or allowing for reasonable structural modifications, such as installing grab bars in the bathroom.
</blockquote>

**Discrimination.** Tenants are protected from various types of discrimination by potential landlords.Specifically, landlords cannot:
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> refuse to rent to a tenant because of their race, religion, color of skin, national origin, sex, age, marital or family status, sexual orientation, immigration status, type of occupation, partnership status, and whether or not they have a disability.
</blockquote>  

Further,
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> landlords cannot refuse to rent to someone based on the source of their income. This means that a landlord cannot refuse to rent to you because you receive social security or any sort of local, state, or federal aid, like food stamps or section 8 housing vouchers.
</blockquote>
