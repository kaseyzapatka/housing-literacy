_This section discusses rent histories and how to request them._

Rent-stabilized tenants are entitled to know their rent history. This information can be accessed several ways:

1.	fill out the [Online Contact Form](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask)
2.	calling the Rent Info Hotline
3.	visiting your Borough or district office in person
4.	requesting your records via mail

The [Tenant Protection Unit's](https://hcr.ny.gov/tenant-protection-unit) website outlines how to access these records and what the tenant needs to do. 'Filling out the online contact form is the easiest and prefered method.'

Tenants can also use the  [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) website to see if their building has been listed as having filed records about rent regulation in the years since 1984. This method, however, is less reliable and only lists the building, not the unit that is under rent regulation. It is important to remember that not every unit in a building is necessarily rent-regulated.

The **New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)** keeps a [list of all the buildings](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rent-stabilized-building-lists.page) that have registered in the past for the rent-stabilization program. However, they do very little to verify the accuracy of these registrations. So, it is possible that your buildingâ€™s units are no longer on their list.

A civic hacker has setup [a website](http://blog.johnkrauss.com/where-is-decontrol/) that allows users to look at the changes in the number of rent-stabilized units across the City from 2007 to 2014. He updated those number in 2016 and has a blog piece about how he obtained those data.
