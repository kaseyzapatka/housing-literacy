_This section discusses MCIs a bit more in depth, especially how they can be used to increase a tenant’s rent._

A `major capital improvement (MCI)` is a when a landlord makes an improvement to the building that benefits or effects all residents. Repairs do not qualify as MCIs.

**Example:** 
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> For example, a new boiler or a new roof are MCIs, but a simply repairing the roof does not count.
</blockquote>

All MCI’s need to be approved by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). When they are approved, DHCR will send out a notice of an MCI rent increase. Sometimes the rent increase will start in the middle of lease. The landlord can add the costs of an MCI into rent increases for unit in the apartment. For rent-stabilized units, increases may not exceed 6 percent of the tenant's rent in NYC and 15 percent outside of NYC. Therefore, large increases must be phased in over multiple years.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> If the landlord has an MCI that warrants an 18 percent increase in rent, those rent increases must be phased in over 3 years—which would mean a 6 percent increase each year. There is no limit on the number of MCIs that a landlord can submit, but tenants have the right to dispute any MCIs that are made by the landlord (see example below).
</blockquote>

**Approval Process and Tenant Contest.** All MCIs are subject to approval by the DHCR. The process gives DHCR time to evaluate the request for the MCI, the responses of tenants, and determine how much rent increase the landlord will be able to collect. The process is as follows:

1.	When a landlord submits an MCI application, DHCR notifies the tenants and gives them an opportunity to submit written responses to the application. They are instructed to comment on the proposed MCI and be as specific as possible in their comments. Tenants can request an extension of time to respond to the application, if they need to.
2.	The landlord must keep a copy of the application with all supporting documentation on the premises so that tenants may examine it. However, a complete copy of the MCI application with all the supporting documentation will always be available at the DHCR for tenant review upon written request. DHCR will review the application, consider the tenant responses and may request additional documentation if deemed necessary.
3.	When processing is complete, DHCR will issue an order either granting a rent increase for the total amount requested, a partial amount, or denying the request. The landlord and the tenants will be notified by DHCR of the amount of the rent increase per room and related terms and conditions in a written order. The rent increase is a `permanent` addition to the rent.

**Types of Increases.** There are two types of increases associated with MCIs:  a permanent prospective increase and a temporary retroactive increase. The `permanent prospective` increase is added to the legal rent and it collected first. So, for example, if the DHCR has approved a $60 increase to my rent for an MCI, then that $60 will permanently be added to my rent—my rent of $800 would permanently increase to $860. However, since the limit on how much my rent can go up due to an MCI is 6 percent ($800 x 6%= $848). The next year, $12 a month will be added to the rent permanently increasing the tenants rent to $860.

`Temporary retroactive payments` are those amounts owed between the effective date and the issue date of the DHCR order granting the MCI. They apply only to rent-stabilized tenants (this does not apply to rent-controlled units) and represents a temporary increase.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> So if the MCI effective data was in September and the issue data for the rent increases began in December, the temporary retroactive payments cover the months of September, October and November.  In the example used above, the tenant owes the landlord an additional $180 (3 months x $60). The landlord is entitled to this money. The way the temporary retroactive payment would be calculated is as follows. 6% of $848 = $50. So the 6% cap leads to an increase of no more than $898. The tenant is already paying $860 because of the $12 added to that as part of the permanent increase. The rent would be increased for four months to $898. The fifth month, the rent would decrease to $888. (Four months of 38 + one month of 28 = $180) The sixth month and thereafter the rent would decrease to $860. See the examples on [page 4 of the Fact Sheet #24](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/orafac24.pdf).
</blockquote>

**Exceptions.** Tenants who are receiving a `SCRIE `(Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption) or `DRIE` (Disability Rent Increase Exemption) do not have to pay any portion of the MCI adjustment that raises their rent over 1/3 of their disposable income. They need to send a copy of the MCI order to the agency overseeing their program (in NYC the Department of Finance). Their rent exemption certificate will be amended to cover the amount of the MCI increase.
