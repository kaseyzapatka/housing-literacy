_This line specifies if any supplementary adjustments are to be added to the monthly rent._

On occasion, the Rent Guidelines Board has approved supplementary adjustments. These are allowable adjustments that can be made to month rents under specific conditions.


**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> In [1988](http://tenant.net/Rent_Laws/RGBorders/apartment-html/rgb20.html), the Rent Guidelines Board allowed supplementary adjustments of up to $5 a month for units that were renting for less than $325 a month for leases after September 30, 1988.
