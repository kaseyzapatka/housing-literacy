_This line specifies the increase in rent that is allowed as a result of prior tenant leaving the unit._

A vacancy allowance is an increase in rent that a landlord is allowed to take as a result of prior tenant leaving the unit. According to the [Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rrra-1997.page) the incoming tenant signs a 2-year lease, the landlord is allowed to increase the prior legal rent, 20 percent. If they sign a 1-year lease, that percentage increase is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the two years and subtracting that from 20.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> In [2016](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) a 2-year increase was 2.0% and 1-year increase was 0.0%. To calculate what a vacancy increase for a 1-year lease, you find the difference between the 2-year increase and the 1-year increase and subtract that from 20%.  So, for 2016, the difference between a 1-year vacancy increase and a 2-year vacancy increase is 2-year (2.00%) - 1-year (0.00%) = 2.00%.

For example, Mr. Pan has signed a 1-year vacancy lease with his landlord in 2016. The prior rent was $800. The landlord can increase rent by 18 percent ($800 x $144 = $944).

20%- 2% (difference of 1- and 2-year lease) = 18 % (1-Year Vacancy Lease Increase)
</blockquote>

With the [Rent Act of 2015,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rent-act-of-2015.page) if a prior tenant was paying a preferential rent, the vacancy lease rent increase that a landlord can collect will be limited.
