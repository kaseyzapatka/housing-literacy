_This section describes what subletting entails and describes how a tenant can assign a lease and what rights they have to do so._

**Subletting.** Subletting refers to when a tenant temporarily leaves the unit and transfers their legal interest in the unit to another, temporarily. `Subletting differs from assigning because it refers to only temporary leave, while assigning is permanent.`

In order to sublet, a tenant is required to do a few things:

- **First,** The tenant must send a written request to the landlord by certified mail, return-receipt requested and must contain the following:
    -  the length of the sublease
    -  the name, home and business address of the proposed subtenant
    -  the reason for subletting
    -  the tenant's address during the sublet
    -  the written conset of any co-tenant or guarantor
    -  a copy of the proposed sublease together with a copy of the tenant's own lease, if available. 

- **Second,** Within ten days after the mailing of this request, the landlord may ask the tenant for additional information. Any request for additional information may not be too difficult for the tenant to provide.

- **Third,** Within 30 days after the mailing of the tenant’s request to sublet or the additional information requested by the landlord, whichever is later, the landlord must send a reply consenting or denying the request. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may sublet, but is responsible for all obligations under the lease.

The landlord cannot _`unreasonably`_ prevent the tenant from subletting. The tenant must notify the landlord in writing as any attempt to sublet the unit. The landlord can either consent or deny that request. If the landlord denies on unreasonable grounds, the tenant can sublet anyways. In the event of an ensuing legal battle, the tenant can re-claim legal fees if they win the case.

If the landlord consents, the tenant may sublet, but remains liable for current and all future monthly rent payments.

The tenant cannot charge the sub-tenant more than the unit's monthly rent, the terms of the sublease cannot supersede those of the primary lease, the tenant cannot sublease the apartment for a period of time that extends beyond those specified in the original lease, and the tenant cannot sublet the unit for more than two years within any four-year period. Additionally, the unit must remain the tenant's primary residence and they must demonstrate their intent to occupy the unit at the end of the sublease.

**Assigning a Lease.** The `primary resident` is the tenant whose name is on the lease. They can assign the lease to another when they are transfer the entire interest of the unit to someone else and permanently vacate the premises. This means they will have no future rights, interests, or claims to the unit. Essentially, they are giving up the apartment.

This can only be done with the written consent of the landlord, who may refuse for any reason or no reason at all. If the landlord's refusal is found to be unreasonable, the tenant is entitled to be released within 30 days of the date from which the request was originally submitted to the landlord.
