_A rent-stabilized rider should appear on the initial lease and all subsequent lease renewals. This rider outlines the tenant’s rights and how the new rent has been calculated._

**Rent-Stabilized Rider.** The rent-stabilized rider should include a few things:

- The name of the tenant as well as the address of the unit
- The signature of the tenant and landlord (or someone working for the landlord)
- A list of the tenant's rights under the Rent Stabilization law including their right to request supporting documentation for IAIs.

Only included on the rider of the initial lease:

- Information on the prior rent and a summary of how the rent was calculated, including individual apartment improvements (IAIs).

For more information on the Rent-Stabilized Rider, see  [Fact Sheet #2](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/orafac2.pdf).

**Initial Lease.** For all rent-stabilized units when tenants receive either an initial lease or any lease renewals, the landlord must include a [New York City LEASE Rider for Rent Stabilized Tenants](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/ralr1.pdf). A `rider` is simply an attachment to a lease. 
This rider:
 
- specifies the prior rent
- the reason for a rent increase
- outlines the rights of the tenant.

Although landlords can receive fines or sanctions if they don’t include the rider, it is very common. Tenants should ask if the unit is rent-stabilized before they sign the initial lease, as well as ask for a rent history. 

Tenants can view a [Tenant’s Complaint of Landlord’s Failure to Renew or Return a Signed Lease](https://rent.hcr.ny.gov/RentConnect/Tenant/leaseViolationOverview) or complete it [online](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/ra90.pdf). Be sure to mark the appropriate box in Part III “Nature of the Complaint."

**Lease Renewals.** Those who live in a rent-stabilized apartment are guaranteed to receive a `lease renewal option of either 1 or 2 years.` The tenant should receive the renewal lease 150 to 90 days before your current lease expires, and then has 60 days to return the signed [Renewal Lease Form](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/rtp8.pdf).

It is up to the tenant to decide whether to sign a 1-or 2-year lease or to tell their landlord that they will not be renewing the lease.
