_This section describes what High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation is and how it works._

There are two ways to deregulate protected units: if the unit reaches a high-rent threshold and then is vacant, or if the unit reaches a high-rent threshold and if the tenant crosses a high-income threshold. This section describes high-rent vacancy deregulation.

**High-Rent High-Income**.`High-Rent Vacancy` deregulation occurs when a unit exceeds its legal monthly rent threshold. As of January 1, 2018, the legal Deregulation Rent Threshold (DRT) is the rent is $2,733.75, and increases each year in accordance with the 1-Year lease increases as approved by the Rent Guidelines Board. Be sure to check the current DRT level, as it changes each year. Once the rent for a unit reaches the legal DRT, the apartment becomes deregulated upon vacancy. Units that are receiving certain tax benefits like 421-a or J-51 are not eligible for High-Rent Vacancy as long as the tax benefits are being received. (One thing to keep in mind is recent changes to the 421-a law in 2015 complicated this issue—while it’s true that units designated as affordable cannot be deregulated, the other units in the building are sometimes not regulated. So, if you live in a building built after 2015, tenants should check if they are in an affordable unit and then whether the building receives benefits under the old 421-a or the new Affordable New York Housing Program.)

There is some recent debate about how a unit can be deregulated using the high-rent vacancy regulation. As has generally been understood, the unit can be deregulated if the high rent threshold is reached during vacancy if the monthly rent exceeds the threshold after including the vacancy bonus and individual apartment improvements (IAIs). However, the language in the most recent (2015) rent law amendments seems to require that the apartment must first reach the deregulation threshold and then become vacant before it can it be deregulated. There has been a lot of discussion about this issue and the Court of Appeals, NY State's highest Court, recently issued a decision on this issue.  However, the Altman Ruling, looked at the language put into the law in 1993. The Court found that the owner could increase the rent during vacancy through IAI's and the vacancy bonus and deregulate the apartment. That case did not look at the 2015 language, which is different.

There are two important ways that landlords can legally raise rents in rent-regulated apartments aside from the allowable rent increases allowed by the Rent Guidelines Board.

- **First,** is what is called a vacancy increase. In between leases, the landlord is entitled to increase the legal allowable rent by a certain percentage. So, when one tenant leaves a unit and another moves in, the landlord is allowed to charge a rent increase during to vacancy. These vary depending on the length of lease that the new tenant has chosen for their lease, but are usually somewhere between a 16 and 20 percent increase—which can quickly change the monthly rent.

- **Second,** landlords can pass off costs of improvements that they have made either to the building (Major Capital Improvements) or to the individual apartment (Individual Apartment Improvements).  Often times a tenant will be notified that the landlord made an Individual Apartment Improvements during vacancy, sometimes resulting in the unit being deregulated.

Usually landlords reach the deregulation rent threshold by combining a vacancy increase with an Individual Apartment Improvement.

**The High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation Process.** When the high rent threshold is met, two documents from the New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HRC) are involved: (1) an HRC HRVD-N and (2) an HRC annual apartment registration. The first document must either be provided at the signing of the new lease or be sent by certified mail to the new tenant within 30 days of when new tenancy commences or when the new lease has been signed by both parties. This document shows the last regulated rent, the reason for the deregulation, and how the new rent was calculated. It must also contain a statement that the tenant can verify the last legal regulated rent or maximum rent by contacting HRC.

The second form is a DHCR annual apartment registration and must be filed with HRC. It indicates the unit’s status as permanently exempt from rent regulation laws and when the deregulation will take affect—generally on the April 1st following the deregulation filing. It must be sent to the first tenant within 30 days after the tenancy commences or the filing of the registration with HRC, whichever occurs later.
