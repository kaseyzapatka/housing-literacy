_This line specifies clauses that can be added to the renewal lease that were not in original lease._

One of the benefits of being a rent-stabilized tenant is that landlords are obligated to offer a renewal lease whenever the current lease expires under the same conditions as the prior lease. That means that the landlord cannot change the conditions of the lease.

This section outlines the few clauses that landlords can include in renewal leases. These clauses are rights that landlord has always been understood to have.

`Part C`  gives some limited exceptions to this rule. All of the exceptions to the rule in Part C are allowed by law.

**Example:** 
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> For example, while the lease must be renewed on the same terms and conditions as the previous lease, by law, the landlord can increase the rent by the rent guidelines board increases. It doesn't matter whether the landlord put a clause in the original lease about increases. The law allows the landlord to annual increases approved by the RGB.
