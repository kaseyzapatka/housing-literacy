_This section describes high-rent high-income deregulation and how it works._

There are two ways to deregulate protected units: if the unit reaches a high-rent threshold and then is vacant, or if the unit reaches a high-rent threshold and if the tenant crosses a high-income threshold. This section talks about high-rent high-income

**High-Rent High-Income**. `High-Rent High-Income` deregulation occurs when the apartment has reached the Deregulation Rent Threshold (DRT) as listed above and the landlord can establish that the tenants living in the apartment have a “total annual federal adjusted gross income” that exceeds $200,000 for each of the preceding two calendar years. This method of deregulation would be used to deregulate a unit in which the high-rent threshold has been met, but the tenant isn’t planning on leaving anytime soon. If a landlord can establish that the tenants living in the unit have a combined income of more than $200,000 for the previous two calendar years, then they can permanently deregulate the unit. Units that are receiving certain tax benefits like 421-a or J-51 are not eligible for High-Rent High-Income as long as the tax benefits are being received. Additionally, units that have tenants with Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemptions (SCRIE) or a Disability Rent Increase Exemptions (DRIE) will not be considered for deregulation.

<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> “Annual income” refers to the federal adjusted gross income as reported on the New York State Income Tax return, and “total annual income” refers to the sum of the annual incomes of all persons who occupy the apartment as their primary residence on other than a temporary basis. The annual incomes of employees of residents or sublettors is not included in the calculation, but rather the prime tenants. If the unit is leased by a corporation, their annual income is not considered.

**The High-Rent High-Income Deregulation Process.**
This is somewhat more of a complicated process then the High-Rent Vacancy process, specifically, there are important dates before which paperwork must be filed.

`On or before May 1 of each year,` the landlord can file an Income Certification Form (ICF) if and only if the apartment has reached the DRT. Tenants are required to certify whether the household’s total annual income was in excess of $200,000—considering only the individuals referenced in the ICF—for each of the two preceding calendar years. The ICF does not require disclosure of any income information other than whether the threshold for each of the two preceding years has been met. It must notify tenants of their protection against harassment and must be delivered either by certified or first class mail or in person. The tenant(s) must return the ICF to the owner within 30 days after service.

If the tenant has certified that their incomes exceeded $200,000 for the two previous calendar years, the landlord must file an Owner’s Petition for Deregulation (OPD) with DHCR no later than June 30, which will request that no longer be subject to rent regulation upon expiration of the existing lease (rent-stabilized apartment), or as of March 1 in the year next succeeding the filing of the OPD (rent-controlled apartment).

If the tenant fails to return the ICF with 30 days after they have received it, or if the landlords disputes it, the landlord can file an OPD no later than June 30. The tenant will then have 60 days to submit the required information to the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) and DHCR, failure to do so could result in an order to deregulate the unit. If DTF notifies DHCR that it has determined that the total annual income was in excess of the threshold amount for each of the two preceding years, then DHCR will notify the owner and tenants of the results of such determination, and both parties will have 30 days to comment. When the comment period expires, DHCR will issue their order, which will be that the apartment is (1) still subject to rent regulation, (2) will be deregulated when the current lease expires, (3) will be deregulated as of March 1 in the year next succeeding the filing of the OPD for rent-controlled apartments.
