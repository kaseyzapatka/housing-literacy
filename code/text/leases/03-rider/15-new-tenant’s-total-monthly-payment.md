_Item 11 indicates the final, total monthly payment for the new tenant._

The final, total monthly payment for the new tenant is indicated here and calculated by adding all line 6 or 6a and lines 7-10 that indicate other surcharges. This is the final amount that the tenant will be charged monthly by the landlord. This should match the rent indicated in either [Item 6 or Part B on the Renewal Lease Form](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/rtp8.pdf).
