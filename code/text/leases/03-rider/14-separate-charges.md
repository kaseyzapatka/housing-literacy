_Items 7-10 indicate other charges that can be added to leases, such as charges for air conditioners, appliances, and other ancillary (or additional) services._

Besides the legal allowable charges, the landlord can include additional charges for air conditioners, appliances, and other supplementary services like a garage.

**Air Conditioners.** In buildings where the landlord pays the electric bill, the landlord can charge extra rent for use of each air conditioner in the apartment. This charge is adjusted every year on October 1 according to the Price Index of Operating Costs for Rent-stabilized Apartment Houses in New York City.

In apartments where the landlord does not pay the electric bill, for every air conditioner that the tenant buys and installs, the landlord can charge $5 per air conditioner, per month. Once this charge has been collected and the air conditioner installed, the tenant cannot remove the air conditioner without the landlord’s consent. This extra charge can only be collected if the air conditioner protrudes beyond the window line, and is not in a “sleeve.”

If the landlord provides the tenant with new air conditioner and installs it after the tenant has given them written consent to do so, the landlord can charge the tenant an individual apartment improvement. This means that the landlord can permanently increase the legal allowable rent 1/60 of the cost of the air conditioner if the building has more than 35 units or 1/40 if the building has less than 35 units. If the unit is rent-stabilized and the air conditioner was installed on or after October 1, 1985, the $5 charge is not included in the base rent. It is included if the unit is rent-controlled, however.  

For more information on air conditioners and collection procedures, see [Fact Sheet #27](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/factsheet27-airconditioners.pdf)

**Appliances.** Landlords do not have to allow tenants to purchase and install washers, dryers, or dish washers. When a landlord allows a tenant to do so, they may collect a fee. This fee is not included in the legal allowable rent or any calculation of it. See the [Amended Operational Bulletin 2005-1](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/operationalbulletin20051surchargestenantinstalledappliances.pdf), for more information on appliances, fees, and how they are calculated.

**Ancillary.** The most common ancillary charge seen in a lease is for a garage (recreational facilities are also common). If these ancillary charges are listed in the initial lease, they need to also be listed in every renewal lease as well. This means that the tenant pays an amount for the apartment and another amount for the garage. It also means that the garage is part of the lease and subject to rent regulation in the same way as the housing it. That means that the landlord must be offer for it to be renewed and any rent adjustments are subject to the Rent Guidelines Board increases. This also means that ancillary services must be part of the lease. See [Fact Sheet #3](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/factsheet3-requiredandessentialservices.pdf) about how ancillary services must also be provided along with basic services.
