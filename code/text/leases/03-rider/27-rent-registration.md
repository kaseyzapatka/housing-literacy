_This section describes the landlord’s requirements to register the rent of a rent-regulated unit._

Units that are subject to rent regulation are required to initially be registered with the DHCR and updated every year. Registrations are accepted starting April 1 of the registration year and must be submitted no later than July 31 of the registration year.

The landlord is required to specify the conditions for each unit that is rent-regulated, however, there is little oversight that ensures that landlords are accurately registering their buildings. This is another reason that it is important to obtain the unit’s rent history so that the tenant can have a sense of the “official” reported status of the unit.

As a rent-stabilized tenant, you are entitled to know your rent history. You can access this information in several ways:

1. fill out the [online contact form](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask)
2. calling the Rent Info Hotline
3. visiting your Borough or district office in person
4. requesting your records via mail

More information about the rent registration process [can be found on HCR’s website here](https://hcr.ny.gov/most-common-rent-regulation-issues-tenants).
