_Here, the landlord indicates that the unit was subject to some other government program when the last tenant moved out._

##### Box D
Generally, this box will be marked if the rent has been altered for some other reason. One example of this might be after renovation when the unit’s size has been dramatically altered; in some cases, the landlord might be able to negotiate a free-market rent, which is a rent for a unit that is agreed upon by the tenant and the landlord and for which the increases are not controlled by the Rent Guidelines Board.  See the [Rent Guidelines Board's website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/housing-types.page) for a more detailed explanation of Private Market (Unregulated).
