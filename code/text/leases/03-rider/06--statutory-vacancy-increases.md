_On these lines, the landlord specifies the specific types of vacancy increases that have been added to the current rent’s calculation._

A `vacancy increase` is an increase allotted to a landlord when they sign the first lease with a new tenant after the previous tenant moved out. The new tenant is called a `vacancy tenant,` because they have moved into a vacant unit.

According to the [Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rrra-1997.page) the incoming tenant signs a 2-year lease, the landlord is allowed to increase the prior legal rent, 20 percent. If they sign a 1-year lease, that percentage increase is calculated by determining the difference in increases for one and two year leases and then subtracting that difference from 20%.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> In [2016](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) a 2-year increase was 2.0% and 1-year increase was 0.0%. To calculate what a vacancy increase for a 1-year lease, you find the difference between the 2-year increase and the 1-year increase and subtract that from 20%.  So, for 2016, the difference between a 1-year vacancy increase and a 2-year vacancy increase is 2-year (2.00%) - 1-year (0.00%) = 2.00%.

For example, Mr. Pan has signed a 1-year vacancy lease with his landlord in 2016. The prior rent was $800. The landlord can increase rent by 18 percent ($800 x $144 = $944).

20%- 2% (difference of 1- and 2-year lease) = 18 % (1-Year Vacancy Lease Increase)

On [page 2 of Fact Sheet #26,](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/orafac26.pdf) you can find the allowable increases for vacancy leases from 2013 to 2018. You can also call New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at `718-739-6400` to get the most recent rates by following the menus.

There are some situations, however, that allow the landlord to take additional increases:

- Limits to vacancy increases due to preferential rents

- Additional allowable increases if the landlord hasn’t collected a permanent vacancy increase within eight years.

- Additional Increases due to low rents, with some conditions
