_The full address of the rent-stabilized unit for which the new lease is being offered should be on this line, including the apartment unit._

Typically, the prior, established legal rents is taken into consideration when calculating the vacancy rent increases on a vacant unit. However, there are some situations in which landlords may be entitled to additional increases beyond the vacancy increase. These include:

1.	**Long Tenancy:** If the last time the unit was vacant was more than 8 years prior to the signing of the new lease, the landlord is entitled to collect additional increases in the rent beyond the vacancy increase for every year since there was last a vacancy. That means if the prior tenant was there for 10 years, the landlord will collect the standard vacancy increase for that year, as well as an additional increase for the additional 10 years the unit was occupied by the same person. Therefore, calculating the new legal rent depends on the years it was continuously occupied by the same tenant beyond the base 8 years, any improvements made to the unit, and the most recent vacancy rate.

2.	**Temporarily Exempt:** If the unit was temporarily exempt for at least 4 years prior to the signing of the new lease, the landlord is entitled to additional increases. An example of a temporarily exempt apartment is an apartment that is used by the super. Therefore, calculating the new legal rent depends on the years the unit was exempt, any improvements made to the unit, and the most recent vacancy rate.

3.	**No Legal Rent History:** When a unit has no legal rent history, the initial legal rent for the initial lease can be constructed from averaging the rents of comparable rent-stabilized apartments in the same building. Only units with the same number of bedrooms can be used in the calculations.

4.	**New Apartment or Newly Constructed:** When the apartment has been recently constructed or is considered to be a new apartment because itâ€™s outer dimensions have been altered (think of converting a two bedroom into a three bedroom by adding one room from another unit), the landlord can negotiate the first legal rent with the tenants that sign the original lease.
