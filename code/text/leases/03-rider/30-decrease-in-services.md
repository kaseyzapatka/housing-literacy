_This section specifies how tenants are to deal with a decrease in services._

According to the Rent Code Amendments of 2014, tenants do not need to notify their landlord before they file an official complaint with DHCR, however, it is still encouraged that tenants notify their landlords first. In some cases, landlords who have not been notified could get more time to address the situation.

**Decrease in Services.** Examples of a decrease in services include the garbage is not being taken out, the elevator does not work, or the tenant is having problems with utilities like the oven, refrigerator, or the toilet.

The tenant is then encouraged to file an official complaint with DHCR, within 10 days of alerting their landlord. If the complaint involves just their unit, they should file an [Application For A Rent Reduction Based Upon Decreased Services - Individual Apartment](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/applicationrentreduction-individual.pdf). Tenants are encouraged to file their [complaint online](https://apps.hcr.ny.gov/ServicesIntake/BuildingSelect.aspx). If the complaint involves the entire building they should file an [Application For A Rent Reduction Based Upon Decreased Building-Wide Services](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/applicationrentreduction-building.pdf). A copy of the complaint should be sent to their landlord or their agent (someone who works for the landlord from a management company) as well. If the problem persists, they could be eligible for a reduction in rent.

**Emergency Conditions.** Some service disruptions constitute emergency conditions, which will be treated with priority and processed as quickly as possible. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- vacate order
- fire
- no water apartment wide
- no operable toilet
- collapsed or collapsing ceiling or walls
- collapsing floor
- no heat/hot water apartment wide (violation required)
- broken or inoperative apartment front door lock
- all elevators inoperable
- no electricity apartment wide
- window to fire escape (does not open)
- water leak (cascading water, soaking electrical fixtures)
- window-glass broken (not cracked)
- broken/unusable fire escapes
- air conditioner broken (summer season)

**Procedures when a Complaint of Decrease in Services is filed:**  

1. DHCR will screen applications and send the tenant an acknowledgement.  

2. The owner will be given a timeline to respond, which will depend on the complaint.

3. The ownerâ€™s response will be sent to the tenant if it is relevant and a DHCR inspection may be scheduled.
  
4. If it is established that the owner failed to maintain required services, DHCR will issue an order to restore those services and reduce rent until those services are restored. The amount of the rent reduction for rent-stabilized tenants rent is generally the most recently charged renewal lease guideline increase, while for rent-controlled tenants the amount will be set by DHCR. Rent will be reduced until those services are restored.
