_If the unit has been occupied for more 8 years, and in that time the landlord was not able to get a vacancy increase, then the landlord is entitled to collect an additional increase._

Landlords are allowed to collect an additional increase on new leases if the units were occupied for more than 8 years. If this is the case, the landlord can multiply the previous legal rent by 0.6 percent and by the number of years.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> Mr. Hendrix paid a vacancy increase upon moving in, lived in the unit for 10 years and most recently paid a legal rent of $800 per month. Ms. King moves into the unit and signs a two- year lease. Then landlord is allowed to collect what’s called a vacancy rent—the first rent collected from a new tenant after a vacancy—from Ms. King of $1,008 per month, calculated as follows:
	
$800 (previous legal regulated rent) + $160 ($800 x 20%) + $48 ($800 x .6% x 10 years) = $1008
</blockquote>

- 	The $800.00 was the legal previous rent.
- 	The landlord was allowed to collect a vacancy increase of up to 20 percent because it was a 2-year lease the new tenant was entering into, which is why the landlord could add $160 ($800 x 20%).
- 	And finally, the landlord was allowed to collect $48 more dollars because it has been 10 years since the landlord had collected a vacancy rent ($800 x .6% x 10 years)
