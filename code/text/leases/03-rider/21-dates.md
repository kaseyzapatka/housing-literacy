On these lines, the landlord specifies the start and end dates of the lease. These should match the dates in [Item 2 on the original lease](https://docdrop.org/static/drop-pdf/Standard-Lease_Apartment-89NLx.pdf) or in [Item 7 on the Renewal Lease Form](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/rtp8.pdf). The landlord should also indicate the date that the lease was completed.
