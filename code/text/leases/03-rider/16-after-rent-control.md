_Here, the landlord indicates that the unit was rent-controlled when the last tenant moved out._

##### Box B
If the unit was formerly rent-controlled, the unit now becomes rent-stabilized. However, the initial rent determined for that unit is initially the rent negotiated by the landlord and the new tenants.  If that rent is above the decontrol threshold, the apartment will be deregulated.  

However, the landlord must provide the tenant with a notice that this is the first rent after the apartment stopped being rent-controlled. If the first rent is under the decontrol threshold, the landlord must give the tenant an Initial Apartment Registration (DHCR Form RR-1). If the first rent is above the decontrol threshold,the landlord must give the tenant a DHCR High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation notice (HRVD-N).  

With either notice, the tenant may challenge the rent by filing a Fair Market Rent Appeal within 90 days of receiving the notice.  If the tenant does not receive the notice, the tenant has four years to challenge the initial rent.  In the appeal, the tenant must claim that the rent is in excess of the fair market rent. The tenant may appeal to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). Tenants using the “Fair Market Appeal Form,” or contact the DHCR’s Office of Rent Administration at `(718) 739-6400.`Tenants can use the [“Fair Market Appeal Form,”](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/ra89fmra.pdf) or contact the DHCR’s Office of Rent Administration at (718) 739-6400.
