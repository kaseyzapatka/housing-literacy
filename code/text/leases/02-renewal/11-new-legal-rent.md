_Item 2, Column F lists the total monthly rent resulting from allowable rent increases. It sums all the allowable increases listed in item 2._

This box indicates the total new rent to be charged. The formula is as follows:

<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> 
New Legal Rent = Column B + Column C + Column D + Column E
</blockquote>

The `New Legal Rent` is the total of `Column B` (the current legal rent) plus `Column C` (allowable increases set by the RGB) plus `Column D` (IAIs, if applicable) plus `Column E` (MCIs, if applicable). This number is the new legal rent for the lease that is being renewed for either a 1-year or 2-year lease.

If a lower rent is to be charged, the small box inside will be marked and item 5 will specify the lower rent. This lower rent will be a preferential rent because the landlord is charging less than the legal allowable rent. Some reasons that a landlord might charge a preferential rent:

1. so they could qualify for a specific program that has a mandatory rent cap
2. because your landlord did not think they could find someone willing to pay the legal maximum rent

**Things to keep in mind about Preferential Rents.** Often tenants do not know that they are paying preferential rents. It is important to know whether the rent is what’s called a “preferential rent.” This means it is lower than legal allowable rent. Often landlords surprise their tenants by raising their rents to the legal allowable rent and ending their preferential rent. They can do this as long as the preferential rent and the legal rent is disclosed in the initial lease and every subsequent renewal lease. Often times, the increase from the preferential to the legal rent is substantial, and tenants leave instead of paying the higher rent. This technique is often used to create high turnover in a unit so that the landlord can more quickly deregulate the unit by making individual apartment improvements (IAIs) and charge vacancy increases. In short, this box and item 5 are the places that indicate whether or not the tenant is paying a preferential or legal rent. Both the legal and the preferential rents should be disclosed on both the original lease and any subsequent leases or renewals.

Also, here is a [good article from Curbed](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15425058/nyc-rent-stabilization-loophole-landlords) that describes how preferential rents can be used against tenants.
