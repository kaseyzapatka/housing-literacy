_The section notifies landlords that they are obligated to present tenants with lease renewal options on the same terms and conditions as the original lease._

Tenants living in rent-regulated units have the right to be offered a 1-year or 2-year lease renewal under the same terms and conditions as the expiring lease. The only exception is for changes that are required to comply with specific laws or regulations. This means that the landlord cannot add any new conditions to the renewal lease, except those specified by the Rent Stabilization Code.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> Ms. Copper signed a 2-year lease without any clauses and riders about lead paint, recyclable materials, late fees or pets. When her new lease expired, she received a renewal lease with the following riders:

1.	Rider 1 requests that the Ms. Cooper advise the owner if a child under 6 years old resides in the apartment so that the landlord can take necessary precautions dealing with lead-based paint hazards.

2.	Rider 2 specifies how certain materials such as paper, cardboard, cans, bottles, etc. must be recycled.

3.	Rider 3 states that the tenant will be liable for a $20 late fee if rent is received by the landlord after the 10th of the month.

4.	Rider 4 prohibits having pets in the apartment.
</blockquote>

In this instance, Riders 1 and 2 are lawful additions to the lease because they are necessary to comply with New York City lead paint and recycling laws. However, Riders 3 and 4 cannot be added to the lease because they constitute material changes to the terms and conditions of the vacancy lease, which did not include a late fee or a pet clause. Ms. Cooper can sign the rider without waiving any rights and may file a lease renewal complaint.

If there are any new conditions that are made to the original lease, a copy of that agreement must be attached to the lease renewal and be signed by both parties.
