_Item 7 indicates the dates when the new lease will commence and terminate._

Generally, the new lease will commence the day after you prior lease expires, as indicated in `Item 1.`

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> If the current lease expires on `3/31/2018,` then the new lease will commence on `4/1/2018.`  The new lease will terminate either 1 or 2 years from when it expires, that is, on either `4/1/2019` or `4/1/2020,` depending on which lease the tenant selects.
</blockquote>
