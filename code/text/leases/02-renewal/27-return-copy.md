_This paragraph notifies landlords of their responsibility to return a copy of the `fully executed lease` (signed by both parties—tenants and landlord) to the tenants._

If the tenant has not received a copy of the fully executed lease with 30 days of when the landlord received the tenant’s signed copies, the tenant should both notify their landlord and file a complaint with the DHCR. Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary.
