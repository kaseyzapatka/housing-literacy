_This section indicates that both the landlord and the tenant agree to the terms of the lease renewal._

Here, both the tenant and the landlord (or someone who works for the landlord like someone from a management company) must sign the lease to acknowledge their acceptance of the terms of the lease. The signatures by both parties are required for the lease to be fully executed and binding.
