_Item 4 specifies separate charges in addition to the legal allowable charges listed in item 2._

Besides the legal allowable charges listed in Item 2, the landlord can include additional charges for air conditioners and appliances.

**Air Conditioners.** In buildings where the landlord pays the electric bill, the landlord can charge extra rent for use of each air conditioner in the apartment. This charge is adjusted every year on October 1 according to the Price Index of Operating Costs for Rent-stabilized Apartment Houses in New York City.

In apartments where the landlord does not pay the electric bill, for every air conditioner that the tenant buys and installs, the landlord can charge $5.00 per air conditioner, per month. Once this charge has been collected and the air conditioner installed, the tenant cannot remove the air conditioner without the landlord’s consent. This extra charge can only be collected if the air conditioner protrudes beyond the window line, and is not in a “sleeve.”

If the landlord provides the tenant with new air conditioner and installs it after the tenant has given them written consent to do so, the landlord can charge the tenant an individual apartment improvement. This means that the landlord can permanently increase the legal allowable rent 1/60 of the cost of the air conditioner if the building has more than 35 units or 1/40 if the building has less than 35 units. If the unit is rent-stabilized and the air conditioner was installed on or after October 1, 1985, the $5.00 charge is not included in the base rent. It is included if the unit is rent-controlled, however.  

For more information on air conditioners and collection procedures, [see FACT SHEET #27](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/factsheet27-airconditioners.pdf).

**Appliances.** Landlords do not have to allow tenants to purchase and install washers, dryers, or dish washers. When a landlord allows a tenant to do so, they may collect a fee. This fee is not included in the legal allowable rent or any calculation of it. See the [Amended Operational Bulletin 2005-1](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/operationalbulletin20051surchargestenantinstalledappliances.pdf), for more information on appliances, fees, and how they are calculated.
