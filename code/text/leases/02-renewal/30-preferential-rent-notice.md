_This paragraph is intended to notify the reader of a signing a lease that has a preferential rent._

Again, this paragraph is designed to notify the reader of a signing a lease renewal that is a preferential rent. A `"preferential rent,"` also called a “pref rent,” is when the landlord charges a rent that is less than the established legal allowable rent. Landlords are free to charge lower rents if they want; however, both the legal rent and the lower preferential rent **HAVE** to be disclosed on the original lease and any subsequent lease renewals.  

This section is designed to also alert tenants to the possibility that landlords might raise the rent to the lawful limits when tenants renew their leases in the future. This may result in a higher than expected rent increase.

**Example:**
<blockquote style="border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 10px;"> For example, the tenant’s established legal rent is $1,500, the established preferential rent is $1,000, and the legal allowable increase for a 1-year lease in 2011 is 3%.  The tenant is currently paying the preferential rent of $1,000. The landlord can legally raise the established rent $45 ($1,500 x 3%=$45) to a total of $1,545 upon the tenant signing a new lease. 

However, the landlord can also keep the rent the same for that year, at $1,000, or make the tenant pay anything up to $1,545. It would still be considered a preferential rent for 2012, and the landlord would have to disclose on the renewal lease that it’s a preferential rent. That means the landlord can raise the rent more than just what the rent guidelines board says the increase is for that year (from $1,000 to $1,545, which is much more than the legal 3% increase) because the landlord was charging them a preferential rent. In the example, the increase is very steep and some tenants might not be able to afford that increase. This is also why some tenants’ rents still increased in years where there was a rent freeze.

`Tenants should be aware that this tactic is often used by landlords who want to force tenants out of rent-regulated units so they can more quickly de-regulate them and charge market rates.`

Here’s a [good article from Curbed](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15425058/nyc-rent-stabilization-loophole-landlords) on how preferential rents are used against tenants.

[Fact Sheet #40](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2018/09/orafac40.pdf) and the [Met Council](http://metcouncilonhousing.org/help_and_answers/preferential_rents) both have more information on preferential rents.
