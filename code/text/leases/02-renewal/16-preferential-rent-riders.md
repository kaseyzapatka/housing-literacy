_Item 5 lists the preferential rent and indicates whether there is a preferential rent rider attached._

A `preferential rent rider` is a document attached to a lease that clarifies a condition or a special arrangement in which a tenant will pay a lower rent than what can legally be charged. When there is a preferential rent rider attached to the lease, it will generally say that the preferential rent has been agreed upon by both parties for the _**duration**_ of the tenancy of the individual tenant. This means that the preferential rent will be paid for the entire time a tenant lives in a unit, not just from lease to lease as the landlord chooses.

Preferential rent riders are not common, especially because it benefits the landlord when the tenant does not know they are paying a preferential rent. Since rent controls constrain how much landlords can charge for rents, the ability of landlords to legally charge more is useful if they are trying to force tenants out so they can add in vacancy bonuses to more quickly attain the deregulation rent threshold. This is a common technique in gentrifying neighborhoods where the sudden influx of residents able to pay higher rents incentivizes landlords to more quickly deregulate their apartments so they can charge market rates.

Here’s a [good article](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15425058/nyc-rent-stabilization-loophole-landlords) on how preferential rents are used against tenants.
