# 12 Current Security Deposit
_Item 3 specifies the current security deposit and the additional amount need resulting from rent increases._

This is the space that indicates the current security deposit that is being held by the landlord for the unit. Generally, this is the same as the legal current rent, although it can be more or less. 

If a rent stabilized building is sold, the landlord must either transfer the security deposits to the new landlord or return the security deposits to the tenant 5 days after the sale. However, the responsibility falls on the purchaser to return the security deposit regardless if the security deposit has been received or returned to the new landlord.
