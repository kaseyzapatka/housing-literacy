# 24 Timing of Lease Renewal
_This section provides information for the landlord and tenant about the proper timeline for the lease renewal process._

The landlord is obligated to provide two copies of the lease renewal to the tenant within a specific window (150 to 90 days before the current lease expires). The date the current lease expires is listed in item 1 of the lease renewal. This is the date by which the tenants must decide whether or not to renew their lease.

 **Important Considerations.** If the landlord is late on offering a lease renewal (less than 90 days before the current lease expires) the tenant has two options.

- **Option 1:** the tenant can stick with the original timeline and begin the lease as if a timely offer been made.
- **Option 2:** the tenant can begin the lease no less than 90 days after the offer has been made to the tenant. If the tenant chooses Option 2, the rent increase rate that is applied is the rate that would have been applied had the lease renewal been offered on a timely date.

In other words, the tenant will not be penalized if the landlord is late in offering a new lease. That being said, the tenant is advised to contact the landlord immediately if they fail to offer them a new lease. If that fails, the tenant is encouraged to file a complaint with New York State Home and Community Renewal: [Landlord’s Failure to Renew or Return a Signed Lease](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/ra90.pdf). This particular complaint can be indicated in Part III “Nature of the Complaint.”

See [Fact Sheet #4](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac4.pdf) for more information on lease renewals.


**Example**

> - Mr. Rivera’s lease expired on July 31, 2011. He did not receive a timely renewal offer between 150 or 90 days of when his lease was set to expire. So he kept paying his rent of $800.
>
>
> - On May 15, 2012, the landlord offers a retroactive lease renewal to begin on August 1, 2011, with rates based upon the 2011 1-year and 2-year renewal rates as approved by the Rent Guidelines Board.
>
>
> -  The choice of when the new lease will start is up to Mr. Rivera. He can have it start on either (1) August 1, 2011 when it was originally supposed to start, or (2) he can have the lease start on September 1, 2012, roughly 90 days from when he received the lease renewal offer.
>
>
> - While the landlord offered the lease renewal at the allowable increase rates of 2011, the rates for 2012 were actually lower. Mr. Rivera is liable for the lower rates, which would be those for 2012.
