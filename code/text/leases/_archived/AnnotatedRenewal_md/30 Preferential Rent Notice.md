# 30 Preferential Rent Notice
_This paragraph is intended to notify the reader of a signing a lease that has a preferential rent._

Again, this paragraph is designed to notify the reader of a signing a lease renewal that is a preferential rent. A **"preferential rent,"** also called a “pref rent,” is when the landlord charges a rent that is less than the established legal allowable rent. Landlords are free to charge lower rents if they want; however, that lower rent has to be disclosed on the original lease and any subsequent lease renewals.  

This section is designed to also alert tenants to the possibility that landlords might raise the rent to the lawful limits when tenants renew their leases in the future. This may result in a higher than expected rent increase. 

**Example**

> If a tenant’s established legal rent is $800.00 and legal allowable increases for 1-year lease in 20011 are 3%, the landlord can raise the rent $24.00 ($800.00 x 3%=$24.00) to a total of $824.00 upon the tenant signing a new lease. However, the landlord can also keep the rent the same at $800.00 for that 2011 1-year lease. The following year in 2012, when the 1-year lease has expired and the tenants has signed another 1-year renewal lease, the land can legally raise the rent that $24.00 as well as whatever the allowable rent is for the 2012 1-year lease. If the percent is again 3% than the landlord can legally raise the rent another $24.72 ($800.00 x 3%=$24.00) for a total of $48.72. 
	
	> So, if the landlord doesn’t raise the rent in 2011, but decides to raise the rent in 2012 to the legal allowable rent, it will jump from $800.00 to $848.72 even though the rate for the second year was 3%. 

**Tenants should be aware that this tactic is often used by landlords who want to force tenants out of rent-regulated units so they can more quickly de-regulate them and charge market rates.**
