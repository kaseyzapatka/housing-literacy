# 11 New Legal Rent
_Item 2, Column F lists the total monthly rent resulting from allowable rent increases. It sums all the allowable increases listed in item 2._

This box indicates the total new rent to be charged. The formula is as follows:

>	New Legal Rent = Column B + Column C + Column D + Column E

The New Legal Rent is the total of Column B (the current legal rent) plus Column C (allowable increases set by the RGB) plus Column D (IAIs, if applicable) plus Column E (MCIs, if applicable). This number is the new legal rent for the lease that is being renewed for either a 1-year or 2-year lease.

If a lower rent is to be charged, the small box inside will be marked and item 5 will specify the lower rent. This lower rent will be a preferential rent because the landlord is charging less than the legal allowable rent. Some reasons that a landlord might charge a preferential rent:

1. so they could qualify for a specific program that has a mandatory rent cap
2. because your landlord did not think they could find someone willing to pay the legal maximum rent.

**Things to keep in mind about Preferential Rents.** Often tenants do not know that they are paying preferential rents. It is important to know whether the rent is either preferential to the legal allowable rent because landlords will often surprise their tenants by making them pay the legal allowable instead of the preferential rent.  Often times, the increase is substantial and tenants must leave. This is often a technique to create high turnover in a unit so that the landlord can more quickly deregulate the unit through IAIs and vacancy increases. In short, this box and item 5 are the places that indicate whether or not the tenant is paying a preferential or legal rent. Both the legal and the preferential rents should be disclosed on both the original lease and any subsequent leases or renewals.
