# 6 Renewal Terms
_Item 2, Column A lists the renewal terms._

One of the rights of tenants living **rent-regulated units** is that they landlord is obligated by law to give tenants the option to renew their lease, either for one year or two. All lease renewals must be kept under the same terms and conditions as the original lease, unless there are some changes that have to be made in order to be in compliance with specific laws or regulation. Those changes would be attached to the renewal lease. This is one of the most powerful rights of rent-regulated tenants. 

There are some exceptions. For example, if the landlord can demonstrate that the tenant does not use the unit as their primary residence or they have violated the lease in some way, they can file a request to deny tenants renewal offers. 

**One year** offers are for leases that end one year from the specified date on the lease renewal, while **two year** offers end after two years. 

Landlords of tenants living in **non-rent-regulated units** must agree to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. If a tenant decides not to renew their lease, the tenant must leave when the lease expires or face eviction. However, leases do sometimes contain automatic renewal clauses. In those cases, the landlord must give the tenant an extra 15-30 daysâ€™ notice.
