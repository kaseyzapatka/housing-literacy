# 3 Tenant's Name and Full Address
_These lines are for listing the current tenants (all those on the original lease) and their address._

Often the landlord or his/her agent will fill this in for the tenant; however, make sure that every tenant who was on the original lease is listed here. This should include every tenantâ€™s full name, the address of the unit, including the apartment unit.
