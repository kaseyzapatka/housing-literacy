# 7 Legal Rent on Current Lease
_Item 2, Column B lists the legal rent on the current lease that is about to expire._

This is the legal rent on the current lease that is about to expire. It represents the highest legal amount that the landlord could have charged you; however, it may not been what you were paying. Sometimes a landlord will charge tenants less than they can legally charge. This is called a **"preferential rent."**  There are several reasons why they may do this, including not finding someone to pay the legal rent or to qualify for a specific program with a rent cap. Regardless, the landlord has to disclose the "legal regulated rent” here. 

Furthermore, the landlord has to register the “legal regulated rent,” with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) each year.  However, landlords often fail to report the accurate rent, renters do not always know their legal rent, and both the legal and the preferential rent are not always made clear on the original lease and all subsequent renewals. Moreover, there is little oversight that makes sure that landlords are correctly reporting the “legal regulated rent.” Rather, the system functions more like an honor system. 

Housing advocates are increasingly finding that landlords are not reporting the “legal regulated rent.” Tenants should be aware of this because it makes it easier for landlords to claim that the unit is deregulated—no longer subject to rent regulation law—or to charge more than they legally should. 

The most important thing that tenants can do is to request their rent history. A **rent history** is a record of all the “legal regulated rents” for a specific unit that were reported each year by the landlord. This is the first step in learning the status of a unit. These should be examined with caution; however, since there is no way to ensure what was disclosed is accurate. Tenants can [request their rent history](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask) be sent to their address online.
