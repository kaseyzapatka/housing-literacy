# 2 Date of the Lease
_On this line, the landlord provides a date for when the document was filled out._

Here the landlord records the date that the lease renewal was filled out. This is not the date of the current lease or for the lease renewal, but the date for when the lease renewal was filled out and either mailed or delivered to the tenant.  Since the landlord is obligated to provide the tenant with a lease renewal form within 150 to 90 days before the current lease expires, the date on the lease renewal from should be within that 150- to 90-day window. The date the current lease expires is listed in item 1 of the lease renewal. This is the date by which the tenants must decide whether or not to renew their lease.

See [Fact Sheet #4](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac4.pdf) for more information on lease renewals.
