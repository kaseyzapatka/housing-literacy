# 8 RGB Allowable Rent Increases
_Item 2, Column C section specifies the legal allowable rent increases for one- and two-year leases that have been determined by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB._

Tenants who live in rent-regulated units are entitled to either one-year or two-year lease renewals. The New York City RGB is mandated by the Rent Stabilization Law in New York City to determine the allowable percentage increases that landlords can charge on one- and two-year lease renewals. The RGB holds meetings beginning in March or April that run until as late June. The mayor appoints board members who hear arguments from a variety of interest groups: owners, tenants, and industry experts. The RGB also carefully weighs staff research.

**Example**
> From leases that were to be renewed between October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, the legal allowable increases were 0.0% for one-year leases and 2.0% for two-year leases. So for a tenant whose current lease had expired had a "legal regulated rent‚Äù at $1,500.00, there would be no increases on one-lease and a $30 ($1,500.00 x 2% = $30.00) increase on a two-year lease. In other words, if they were to sign a one-year lease they would pay $1,500.00 and $1,530.00 for two-year lease.
