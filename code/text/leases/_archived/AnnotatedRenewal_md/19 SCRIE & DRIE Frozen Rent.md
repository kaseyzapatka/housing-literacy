_**Special Note for Tenants with preferential rents:** If you have a preferential rent—a rent is below the legal allowable rent that a landlord can charge—you may still be eligible to apply. However, rents  will not necessarily be frozen at the preferential level, but at 1/3 of the tenant’s household income, which might be higher than the preferential rent. Tenants should speak to someone about their eligibility. [Applications can be found online](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentfreeze/index.page)_
