# 5 Date of Expiration of Current Lease
_Item 1 lists the date of expiration of the current lease._

The date of the expiration of the current lease should be listed here. This should match the expiration that is listed in **Item 2 “Length of Lease”** (or its equivalent section) in the original lease or in **Item 1** on the previous lease renewal. 

Tenants are to receive the lease renewal within a specific window: “not more than 150 days and not less than 90 days prior to the end of the tenant's lease term.”  This date is the date to which this window refers. It is also the date by which the tenant must decide to renew their lease for either 1 or 2-years. 
 Important considerations

If the landlord is late on offering a lease renewal (less than 90 days before the current lease expires) the tenant has two options. 

- **Option 1:** the tenant can stick with the original timeline and begin the lease as if a timely offer been made. 
- **Option 2:** the tenant can begin the lease no less than 90 days prior after the landlord offers the new lease to the landlord. If the tenant chooses Option 2, the rent increase rate that is applied is the rate that would have been applied had the lease renewal been offered on a timely date. 

In other words, the tenant will not be penalized if the landlord is late in offering a new lease. That being said, the tenant is advised to contact the landlord immediately if they fail to offer them a new lease. If that fails, the tenant is encouraged to file a complaint with New York State Home and Community Renewal. The appropriate document can be found here:

**Example.**

1. Mr. Rivera’s lease expired on July 31, 2011. He did not receive a timely renewal offer between 150 or 90 days of when his lease was set to expire. So he kept paying his rent of $800. 

2. On May 15, 2012, the landlord offers a retroactive lease renewal to begin on August 1, 2011, with rates based upon the 2011 1-year and 2-year renewal rates as approved by the Rent Guidelines Board. 

3. The choice of when the new lease will start is up to Mr. Rivera. He can have it start on either (a) August 1, 2011 when it was originally supposed to start, or (b) he can have the lease start on September 1, 2012, roughly 90 days from when he received the lease renewal offer. 

4. While the landlord offered the lease renewal at the allowable increase rates of 2011, the rates for 2012 were actually lower. Mr. Rivera is liable for the lower rates, which would be those for 2012.
