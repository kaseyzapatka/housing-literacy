# 13 Security Deposit Increase
_Item 3 specifies the current security deposit and the additional amount need resulting from rent increases._

In this section of item 3, the landlord indicates the security deposit increase, that is, the additional money that will be collected from the tenant to cover the new security deposit. Often, the security deposit is equal to one month’s rent, so the security deposit increase will be the same amount as the increase in the rent.

**Example**
> If the current rent is $1,500.00 and a 1-year legal allowable increase is 3%, than the rent will increase by 3% of $1,500.00, or $45.00, to a total of $1,545.00  
>
>> $1,500.00  + $45 = $1,545.00
>
> If the current security deposit held by the landlord is the same as one month’s rent at $1,500.00, than the security deposit increase to be collected will be $45.00.
