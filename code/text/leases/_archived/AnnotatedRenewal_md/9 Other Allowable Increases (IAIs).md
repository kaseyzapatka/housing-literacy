# 9 OTHER ALLOWABLE INCREASES (IAIs)
_Item 2, Column D lists additional, allowable increases to the monthly rent._

This section specifies the additional increases that landlords are allowed to add to the Rent Guideline Board’s (RGB) allowable increases. The most common increases included here are what is called an IAI. When significant improvements are made to a rent-regulated unit, they are classified as Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI). This includes: 

1. an increase in the unit’s size, for example, adding a new room or a balcony; 
2. new services provided by the landlord, like if the landlord installs a central air conditioner; 
3. substantial improvements that were made to the unit, like new flooring or new windows; or 
4. new furniture or furnishings, like a new refrigerator or kitchen cabinets. 

When these types of improvements are made to the unit, the landlord is entitled to an increase in the legal allowable rent. If the IAI is made while there is a tenant occupying the unit, the landlord must have the written permission of the tenant before they make any improvements. If the unit is not occupied, the landlord does not need any written permission. 

**Common Examples of an IAI.** Some common examples of an IAI include new kitchen appliances, kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, new closets, new washing machines, and new flooring. IAIs are not granted for routine maintenance like painting, skim-coating, scraping, or plastering. See [page 4 of this Operational Bulletin](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/OperationalBulletins/orao20161.pdf) for more examples. 

**Rent Increases.** Landlords of buildings that have more than 35 units may charge tenants 1/60th of the cost of the improvement, while landlords of units with less than 35 units may only charge 1/40th of the cost of the improvement. IAIs are permanent increases to the rent.

**Example**
> In a building that has more than 35 units, a new dishwasher was installed for $900. The resulting IAI that the landlord could claim would be $15 (1/60th of $900). If the legal rent is $1,500 and the legal allowable rent increase for that year is 3%, the resulting rent would be $1,500 + $45 (3% of $1,500) + $15 (IAI) = $1,560. 

**How IAIs differ from MCIs.**
An Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI) differs from a Major Capital Improvement (MCI) in a few ways. 

1. First, IAIs are only made to an individual apartment, while MCI are benefits to all the residents of the building. One exception, however, is that a landlord may be able to get an MCI if they replace they (for example) replace the sinks in each of the units in the building. 

2.	Second, IAIs require written permission from the tenant if the unit is occupied, while MCIs require approval from the New York State Home and Community Renewal (HCR).  Most IAIs are made to units when they are vacant, because no permission is needed.

3.	Third, the rent increases are calculated differently. For IAIs, they are either 1/40th or 1/60th of the cost of the improvement depending the number of units in the building, while rent increases for MCIs are determined by HCR and cannot exceed 6% of the rent, annually. 


#### SCRIE and DRIE
Tenants who are receiving a SCRIE (Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption) or DRIE (Disability Rent Increase Exemption) do pay for IAI adjustments, unlike MCIs, which they do not. 

**Complaints.** If you did not receive a rider in your lease explaining the IAI increases, you should ask the landlord for it or [file a complaint](http://www.nyshcr.org/AboutUs/ContactUs.htm#rent-admin) with New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR). 

If the you have already signed a lease, but think that the charges are exaggerated or false, you can [file a rent overcharge claim](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/ra89.pdf). In defending their case, the landlord would have to provide receipts or proof of some sort. You can also file a rent overcharge claim with New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).
