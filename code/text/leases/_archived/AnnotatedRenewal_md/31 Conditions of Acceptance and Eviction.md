# 31 Conditions of Acceptance and Eviction
_These last few sections are designed alert tenants of their conditions of acceptance, their potential eviction if they fail to comply, and their rights to make official complaints._

**Conditions of Acceptance.**
Upon signing the lease and indicating their desired tenancy (1-year or 2-years), the tenants are responsible for adhering to the new lease conditions: the rent increases, any lawful changes made or attached to the lease renewal, paying an additional security deposit, or vacating the unit when the lease has expired. 

**Potential Eviction.**
Tenants have 60 days from when they receive the renewal lease form to sign and return their decision to their landlord. If they fail to return their signed renewal lease form within 60 days, the landlord does not have to renew the lease and can ask them to leave the unit or begin eviction proceedings. 


**Official Complaints**
If the tenant has not received a copy of DHCR Lease Rights Rider with the lease renewal form, has not received the lease renewal within the proper window (150-90 days before their current lease expires), or did not receive a fully execute copy (the final coy that was signed by both tenant(s) and landlord), they can notify the Division of Housing and Community Renewal and file a complaint. 

If the tenant has not received a copy of the fully executed lease with 30 days of when the landlord received the tenant’s signed copies, the tenant should both notify their landlord and file a complaint with the DHCR. Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary. 

The Tenant should mark the appropriate box in **Part III “Nature of the Complaint”** on the ["Tenant's Complaint of Owner's Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease"](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/) form.
