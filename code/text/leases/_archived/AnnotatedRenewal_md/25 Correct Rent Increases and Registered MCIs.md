# 25 Correct Rent Increases and Registered MCIs
This section notifies landlords of their responsibilities to complete all the items in Part A of the Lease Renewal, which specifically detail how the rent was calculated. 

This means that any rent increases as noted in **Items 2 and 4** must follow the applicable Rent Guidelines Board adjustments and any other adjustments must be authorized by the Rent Stabilization Code. Additionally, any increases collected from Major Capital Improvements (MCIs) adjustments as noted in **Item 2 Column E** must have been registered with DHCR at the appropriate time. 

The tenant can verify the accuracy of what the landlord has filled out in Part A by looking at the [history of allowable rent Increases through 2018.](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf).

**Example**

> From leases that were to be renewed between October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, the legal allowable increases were 0.0% for one-year leases and 2.0% for two-year leases. So for a tenant whose lease was eligible for renewal, and they had a "legal regulated rent” at $1,500, there would be no increases on one-leases and a $30 increase on all two-year leases. In other words, if they were to sign a one-year lease they would pay $1,500 and $1,530 for two-year leases.
