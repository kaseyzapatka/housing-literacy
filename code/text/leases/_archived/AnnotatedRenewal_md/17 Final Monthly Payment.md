# 17 Final Monthly Payment
_Item 6 specifies the final monthly payment to be received from the tenant to the landlord on either a 1-year or 2-year lease renewal. This number will be listed again in Part B._

The amount from either **item 2F** (the legal allowable rent) or from **item 5** (the preferential rent) will be entered here in appropriate space for either a 1-year or 2-year lease renewal. If there are additional charges to be added from item 4, they will be entered in the third blank space, with the final amount entered in either of the last two blanks spaces, depending on if the lease renewal is for 1-year or 2.

**Example**
> For example, for a 2-year lease renewal with a legal allowable rent of **$1,573.12** and no additional charges would look like this:
>
>	 6. Tenant shall pay a monthly rent (enter amount from 2F or 5) of $______________ for a 1 year renewal or $ ______1,573.12_____ for a 2 year renewal, plus total separate charges (enter amount from 4) $_____________ for a total monthly payment of $_____________ for a 1 year renewal or $_____1,573.12 _______ for a 2 year renewal.
