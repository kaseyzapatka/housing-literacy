# 27 Return Copy
_This paragraph notifies landlords of their responsibility to return a copy of the **fully executed lease** (signed by both parties—tenants and landlord) to the tenants._ 

If the tenant has not received a copy of the fully executed lease with 30 days of when the landlord received the tenant’s signed copies, the tenant should both notify their landlord and file a complaint with the DHCR. Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary. 

> The tenant should mark the appropriate box in Part III “Nature of the Complaint” on the ["Tenant's Complaint of Owner's Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease"](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/), which can be accessed online.
