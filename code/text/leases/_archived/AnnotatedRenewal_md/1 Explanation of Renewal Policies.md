# 1 Explanation of Renewal Policies
_A quick overview of the renewal process for rent-regulated tenants._

Landlords of tenants living in non-rent-regulated units must agree to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. If a tenant decides not to renew their lease, the tenant must leave when the lease expires or face eviction. However, leases do sometimes contain automatic renewal clauses. In those cases, the landlord must give the tenant an extra 15-30 days’ notice.

Landlords of renters living in a rent-regulated apartment are obligated by law to give tenants the option to renew their lease, either for one year or two. All lease renewals must be kept under the same terms and conditions as the original lease, unless there are some changes that have to be made in order to be in compliance with specific laws or regulation. Those changes would be attached to the renewal lease.  This is one of the most powerful rights that rent-regulated tenants have. However, there are some exceptions, like if the landlord can demonstrate that the tenant does not use the unit as their primary residence or they have violated the lease in some way. Generally, tenants are given the option to renew the lease under the same terms, **UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT CHANGE IN THE LAW.**

Any rent increases must follow the legal allowable increases specified by the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) **EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE THE TENANT HAS A PREFERENTIAL RENT.**  A **preferential rent** is when the landlord charges a rent that is less than the established legal regulated rent. The landlord is free to charge a lower rent if they desire; however, that lower rent HAS to be disclosed on the original lease and any subsequent lease renewals. **IF THE LEGAL ALLOWABLE RENT IS ALREADY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE RGB’S INCREASE WOULD ALLOW, THE UNIT PROBABLY HAD A PREFERENTIAL RENT AT SOME POINT AND THE LANDLORD CAN RAISE THE RENT UP TO THE LEGAL ALLOWABLE RENT EVEN IF IT’S HIGHER THAN THE RGB’S ALLOWABLE PERCENTAGE.** You can calculate the legal allowable rent by looking at the unit’s rent history (which can be requested online) and comparing it to the history of Allowable Rent Increases and any additional charges that should be disclosed on your lease or lease renewal.

**Lease Renewal Timeline.**
The landlord must give the tenant written notice of their right to renew between 150 and 90 days of the expiration of the lease. The tenant has 60 days from when they were given the notice to renew. If the tenant does not accept, the landlord can seek eviction proceedings. If the tenant accepts, the landlord has 30 days to return the signed lease.  If you have not received a lease renewal from the landlord, it is recommended that you contact the landlord immediately, ask for a lease, and notify them of your desire to stay.

Once you have signed the lease renewal, the lease is considered to be binding, and you should pay the appropriate increase when the current lease expires, whether or not the landlord returns a copy of the lease after they have signed it. If the landlord fails to renew a lease or if they fail to return a copy of the signed lease, you should contact your landlord about providing you a copy or lodge a complaint with New York State Homes and Community Renewal. Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary.  The form for lodging a complaint can be found below:
