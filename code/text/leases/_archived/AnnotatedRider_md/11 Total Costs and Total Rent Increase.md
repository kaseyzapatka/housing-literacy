# 11 Total Costs and Total Rent Increase
_On these two lines, the landlord specifies the total labor costs and calculates the total allowable rent increases as a result of the Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs)._

On the first line, the landlord reports the total costs of the parts and the labor for the indicated individual apartment improvements. The landlord then calculates the total allowable rent increase resulting from those IAIs. More information on [IAIs can be found online](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/OperationalBulletins/orao20161.pdf).

Calculating the rent increases from IAIs. Landlords of buildings that have more than 35 units may charge tenants 1/60th of the cost of the improvement, while landlords of units with less than 35 units may only charge 1/40th of the cost of the improvement.

**Example**
> Landlords of buildings that have more than 35 units may charge tenants 1/60th of the cost of the improvement, while landlords of units with less than 35 units may only charge 1/40th of the cost of the improvement. IAIs are permanent increases to the rent.
>
>       For example, in a building that has more than 35 units, and a new dishwasher was installed for $900. The resulting IAI that the landlord could claim would be $15 (1/60th of $900). If the legal rent is $1,500 and the legal allowable rent increase for that year is 3%, the resulting rent would be $1,500 + $45 (3% of $1,500) + $15 (IAI) = $1,560
