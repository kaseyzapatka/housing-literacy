# 7 Vacancy Allowance
_This line specifies the increase in rent that is allowed as a result of prior tenant leaving the unit._

A vacancy allowance is an increase in rent that a landlord is allowed to take as a result of prior tenant leaving the unit. According to the [Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rrra-1997.page) the incoming tenant signs a 2-year lease, the landlord is allowed to increase the prior legal rent, 20 percent. If they sign a 1-year lease, that percentage increase is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the two years and subtracting that from 20.

**Example**
> For example, Mr. Pan has signed a 1-year vacancy lease with his landlord in 2016. The prior rent was $800.00. The landlord can increase rent by 18 percent ($800.00 x $144.00 = $944.00).
>
>			20%- X% (difference of 1- and 2-year lease) = 1-Year Vacancy Lease Increase
>
> This because in [2016](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) a 2-year increase was 2.0% and 1-year increase was 0.0%, and the difference is 2-year (2.00%) - 1-year (0.00%) = 2.00%.

###### With the [Rent Act of 2015,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rent-act-of-2015.page) if a prior tenant was paying a preferential rent, the vacancy lease rent increase that a landlord can collect will be limited.
