# 2 Sections to Complete
*Section 1 specifies which sections of the lease need to filled out. Section 1 is only filled out the first time that the tenant moves into the unit.*

**Vacancy vs Renewal Leases.**
There are two types of leases for rent-stabilized tenants: vacancy and renewal leases. A **vacancy lease** is offered to new tenants in a unit—when one tenant moves in because the last tenant moved out, whereas a **renewal lease** is offered to a tenant already living in the unit because they have decided to extend their lease. The main difference between these two leases is that landlords are entitled to raise the rent up to 20 percent *in addition to* the rent increases approved by the Rent Guidelines Board.

For more information on vacancy leases, see [Fact Sheet# 5](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac5.pdf).

**Things to Remember**
- Landlords cannot collect more than one vacancy lease in a calendar year (January 1 thru December 31. That means that if they have more than one first time tenant in one of their units, they can only increase the rent once for a vacancy lease.
- Landlords charging a preferential rent—a rent lower than the legal allowable rent—are only entitled to up 20 percent, but in a step process: 5% if the last vacancy lease commenced less than two years ago, 10% if less than three years ago, 15% if less than four years ago and 20% if four or more years ago.

**Example**
> Mr. Solano and Ms. Barsotti both live in New York City, in rent-stabilized apartments. Mr. Solano has been living in the same unit for the last 3 years when his lease expired in May, while Ms. Barsotti is moving in her first apartment. Mr. Solano will be offered a lease renewal, whereas Ms. Barsotti will be offered a vacancy lease.

**Sections.**
If the lease is a vacancy lease, then Section 1 must be filled out. If the lease is a lease renewal, Section 1 can be skipped.
