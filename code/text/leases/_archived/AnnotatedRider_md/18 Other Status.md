#### Box D
Generally, this box will be marked if the rent has been altered for some other reason. One example of this might be after renovation when the unitâ€™s size has been dramatically altered; in some cases, the landlord might be able to negotiate a free-market rent, which is a rent for a unit that is agreed upon by the tenant and the landlord and for which the increases are not controlled by the Rent Guidelines Board.  See the [Rent Guidelines Board' website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/housing-types.page) for a more detailed explanation of Private Market (Unregulated).
