# 6 (iii) Additional Increase Due to Low Rent
_If the unit previously had a low rent, then the landlord is entitled to collect an additional increase._

If certain cases, where the rent is very low (usually between $300 and $500) the landlord is entitled to collect an addition increase in rent beyond allowable legal rental increases or vacancy increases. For more information, see [page 3 of Fact Sheet #26](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac26.pdf).

Only (a) or (b) needs to be completed depending on the prior legal rent. Line (a) should be completed if the prior rent was below $300.00, and line or (b) if between $300.00 and $500.00
