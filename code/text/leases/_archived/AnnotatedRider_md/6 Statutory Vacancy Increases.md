# 6 Statutory Vacancy Increases
_On these lines, the landlord specifies the specific types of vacancy increases that have been added to the current rent’s calculation._

A **vacancy increase** is an increase allotted to a landlord when they sign the first lease with a new tenant after the previous tenant moved out. The new tenant is called a vacancy tenant, because they have moved into a vacant unit.

According to the [Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rrra-1997.page) the incoming tenant signs a 2-year lease, the landlord is allowed to increase the prior legal rent, 20 percent. If they sign a 1-year lease, that percentage increase is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the two years and subtracting that from 20.

**Example**
> For example, Mr. Pan has signed a 1-year vacancy lease with his landlord in 2016. The prior rent was $800.00. The landlord can increase rent by 18 percent ($800.00 x $144.00 = $944.00).
>
> 	 20%- X% (difference of 1- and 2-year lease) = 1-Year Vacancy Lease Increase
>
> This because in [2016](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) a 2-year increase was 2.0% and 1-year increase was 0.0%, and the difference is 2-year (2.00%) - 1-year (0.00%) = 2.00%.
