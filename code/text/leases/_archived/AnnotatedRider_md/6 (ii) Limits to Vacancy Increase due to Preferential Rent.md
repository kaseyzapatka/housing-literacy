# 6 (ii) Limits to Vacancy Increase due to Preferential Rent
_If the unit was vacant for more than 8 years, then the landlord is entitled to collect an additional increase._

Landlords are allowed to collect an additional increase on new leases if the units were vacant for more than 8 years. If this is the case, the landlord can multiply the previous legal rent by 0.6 percent and by the number of years.

**Example**
> Mr. Hendrix paid a vacancy increase upon moving in, lived in the unit for 10 years and most recently paid a legal rent of $800.00 per month. Ms. King moves into the unit and signs a two- year lease. Then landlord is allowed to collect what’s called a vacancy rent—the first rent collected from a new tenant after a vacancy—from Ms. King of $1,008.00 per month, calculated as follows:
>
>     $800.00 (previous legal regulated rent) + $160.00 ($800 x 20%) + $48.00 ($800.00 x .6% x 10 years) = $1008.00
>
>      •	The $800.00 was the legal previous rent.
>      •	The landlord was allowed to collect a vacancy increase of up to 20 percent because it was a 2-year lease the new tenant was entering into, which is why the landlord could add $160.00 ($800 x 20%).
>      •	And finally, the landlord was allowed to collect $48.00 more dollars because it has been 10 years since the landlord had collected a vacancy rent ($800.00 x .6% x 10 years).
