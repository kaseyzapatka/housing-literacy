# 13 New Legal Regulate Rent
_Item 6 and 6a indicate the new legal regulated rent that will be charged to the tenant._

Item 6 is the new legal rent that will be charged to the tenant. It is calculated by summing all the totals from Items 1-5.  If a preferential rent is to be charged instead, this is indicated on the line for Item 6a, instead.

A **"preferential rent,"** also called a “pref rent,” is when the landlord charges a rent that is less than the established legal allowable rent. Landlords are free to charge lower rents if they want; however, that lower rent **has to be disclosed on the original lease and any subsequent lease renewals.**

Although landlords are obligated to register the "legal regulated rent" with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), they do not always report the accurate rent, renters do not always know what the actual rent is, and both the legal and the preferential rent are not always made clear on the original lease and all subsequent renewals.

Some reasons that a landlord might charge a preferential rent:
1. so they could qualify for a specific program that has a mandatory rent cap
2. because your landlord did not think they could find someone willing to pay the legal maximum rent.

There might be other reasons as well. Many housing advocates and tenant organizers are finding that preferential rents are being used to either cover fraudulent "legal" rents or as a strategy to force out tenants to bring in new ones that can pay higher rents. Here’s a [good article](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15425058/nyc-rent-stabilization-loophole-landlords) on how preferential rents are used against tenants.

**Fraudulent Rents.** If a unit is rent-regulated, landlords are required by the rent regulation law to register them with the DHCR. Each year, they have to update the legal rent that they charge their tenants. However, since DHCR does not verify each individual rent registration, only investigates tenant requested inquiries into fraudulent legal rents, and there is a four-year statute of limitations on auditing alleged fraudulent rents, it is easy and very common for landlords to registered rents that are significantly higher than what they legally should be. In doing this, they can more quickly reach the rent deregulation threshold which would remove the building or units from rent regulation. The combination of a lack of oversight, little knowledge about rent histories, and the statute of limitations on examining these cases enables landlords to systematically deregulate buildings and shirk the rent-regulated housing stock under the façade of legality.

**Raising Rents.** The other common reason that preferential rents are used is to be able to dramatically raise rents when a tenant renews their contract in the hopes that they will decide to move out and will be replaced by someone who can pay a higher rent according to the legal “allowable” rent that they have been registering with the DHCR. It is not uncommon for the difference in preferential versus legal rents to be as much as double, or more.

**Example**
> Imagine if you usually pay a preferential rent of $1,200.00, but the your legal allowable (or what has been registered with DHCR) is $2,700.00. That’s a $1,500.00 increase in rent each month that most people cannot pay, especially if it is raised suddenly when the lease is due for renewal.

When this occurs, it is important to request what is called a rent history. You can request that the DHCR send you the rent history for your unit, which shows both the legal and preferential rents that the landlord has been claiming every year. Knowing your rent history is an important step in being able to challenge fraudulent legal rents and to protect yourself against big rent hikes.

**Disclosure of a Preferential Rent.** It is important to know if the lease states whether or not there is a preferential rent, that is, that a rent that is lower than the legal allowable rent. While landlords are obligated to report, they do not always do so. However, whether or not the landlord discloses the preferential rent is very important, because it affects when they can charge the legal regulated rent.

- If the preferential rent was not disclosed on the original lease agreement and any subsequent renewals, then the rent you are currently paying is the only rent the landlord can charge you.
- If the landlord disclosed the preferential rent, the landlord can raise the rent to the legal regulated rent at the end of a lease term.
- However, if there was a preferential rider attached to the agreement that says the preferential rent is for the duration of the time the same tenant lives in the unit, the landlord can only raise the rent back to the legal regulated rent when the tenant leaves the unit. See [Item 20 on the New York City Lease Rider For Rent Stabilized Tenants](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/Ralr1.pdf) or Fact Sheet #40](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac40.pdf) for more information about preferential rents.

Preferential rents are disclosed on [Item 5 on the Renewal Lease Form](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/rtp8.pdf) and general on [Item 3 of the Standard Form of Apartment Lease](https://docdrop.org/static/drop-pdf/Standard-Lease_Apartment-89NLx.pdf).

If you challenge the legal rent history that a landlord claims and the rent immediately preceding the year before was preferential, DHCR will investigate that rent even if it is beyond the four-year statute of limitations. However, often times landlords can back edit rent history logs to reflect proper disclosure of legal rents. So be strategic in how you handle this matter.

**Preferential Rents and Vacancy Increases.** Preferential rents also affect how much a much a landlord can charge on a vacancy rent increase. According to the Rent Act of 2015, if a vacating tenant was paying a preferential rent, the rent increases offered on the lease to a new tenant are limited to 5% if the previous vacancy lease commenced less than two years ago, 10% if less than three years ago, 15% if less than four years ago and 20% if four or more years ago. So, for example, if a tenant moves into a unit in 2016 and pays a preferential lease and then moves out in 2017, the landlord can only raise the rent on the legal rent 5% instead of the normal rate.

[Fact Sheet #40](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac40.pdf) and the [Met Council](http://metcouncilonhousing.org/help_and_answers/preferential_rents) both have more information on preferential rents.
