# 17 Government Program Status
_Here, the landlord indicates that the unit was subject to some other government program when the last tenant moved out._

#### Box C
This box will be marked if the unit is covered by a specific government program that alters the amount of rent that will be collected or that the renter will pay. Some examples might include, Section-8, Mitchell-Lama, and other types of affordable housing. See the [Rent Guidelines Boardâ€™s website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/housing-types.page) for a more detailed explanation of the various types of housing. Make sure that the program and the amount are both specified correctly.
