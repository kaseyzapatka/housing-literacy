# 10 IAI Items to be Verified
_Improvements on marked items are the renovations that have been made and which qualify for rent increases as Individual Apartment Improvements._

**Items A** (Bathroom Renovations), **Item B** (Kitchen Renovations), and **Item C** (Other) are the three categories of the different types of renovations that qualify for Individual Apartment Improvements (IAIs) and for which rent increases can be collected. The marked boxes in the three different sections indicate which renovations have been made.

### What are IAIs?
Apartment Improvements (IAIs) are significant improvements that are made to a rent-regulated unit. These improvements allow for the landlord to collect addition rents. IAIs are not standard repairs but improvements made to the unit. They can include

1. an increase in the unitâ€™s size, for example, adding a new room or a balcony;
2. new services provided by the landlord, like if the landlord installs a central air conditioner;
3. substantial improvements that were made to the unit, like new flooring or new windows; or
4. new furniture or furnishings, like a new refrigerator or kitchen cabinets.

**Common Examples of an IAI.** Some common examples of an IAI include new kitchen appliances, kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, new closets, new washing machines, and new flooring. IAIs are not granted for routine maintenance like painting, skim-coating, scraping, or plastering. See [page 4 of this Operational Bulletin](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/OperationalBulletins/orao20161.pdf) for more examples.
