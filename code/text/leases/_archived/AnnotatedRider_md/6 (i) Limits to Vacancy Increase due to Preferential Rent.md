# 6 (i) Limits to Vacancy Increase due to Preferential Rent
_If the unit had a preferential rent, there are limits on how much the landlord can collect for vacancy increases._

> (i)	The Rent Act of 2015 limits the amount of the vacancy increase that can be collected by the landlord if the previous tenant was paying a preferential rent. A preferential rent is a rent charged to the tenant that is lower than their legal allowable rent.

The rent increases offered on the lease to a new tenant are limited to 5% if the previous vacancy lease commenced less than two years ago, 10% if less than three years ago, 15% if less than four years ago and 20% if four or more years ago. So, for example, if a tenant moves into a unit in 2016 and pays a preferential lease and then moves out in 2017, the landlord can only raise the rent on the legal rent 5% instead of the normal rate.

|**Last Vacancy Lease Commenced**:| **Allowable Vacancy Increase**|
|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|Less than 2 years ago            |        5%                     |
|Less than 3 years ago            |        10%                    |
|Less than 4 years ago            |        15%                    |
|4 or more years ago              |        20%                    |


While preferential rents are supposed to be disclosed on the original lease and all subsequent lease renewals, they are often not. The best way to find out if you have a preferential rent is to ask your landlord or get [a copy of the unitâ€™s rent history](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask).
