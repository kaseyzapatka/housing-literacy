# 19 Section 2: Vacancy and Renewal Leases
_Section 2 is it to be completed for both vacancy and renewal leases._

**Vacancy Lease versus Renewal Leases.** Leases for rent-stabilized units in New York City can be divided into two main categories: [vacancy leases and renewal leases](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/rent-guidelines/vacancy-leases.page). A tenant signs a vacancy lease when moving into a vacant rent stabilized apartment, while a renewal lease is any and all subsequent leases signed by that same tenant for that same unit.

**Vacancy Allowance versus Rent Adjustments.** With different leases come different increases: a vacancy increase and a rent adjustment.

- A vacancy allowance is an increase allotted to a landlord when they sign the first lease with a new tenant after the previous tenant moved out. The new tenant is called a vacancy tenant, because they have moved into a vacant unit.
- A rent adjustment are increases that are approved by the [Rent Guidelines Board (RGB)](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/about/about.page) each year.

**Vacancy Allowance Calculations.** Vacancy allowances are allowed by the rent laws, while rent adjustments are approved by the RGB.

According to the [Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rrra-1997.page) the incoming tenant signs a 2-year lease, the landlord is allowed to increase the prior legal rent, 20 percent. If they sign a 1-year lease, that percentage increase is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the two years and subtracting that from 20.

**Example**
> For example, Mr. Pan has signed a 1-year vacancy lease with his landlord in 2016. The prior rent was $800.00. The landlord can increase rent by 18 percent ($800.00 x $144.00 = $944.00).
>
> 	20%- X% (difference of 1- and 2-year lease) = 1-Year Vacancy Lease Increase
>
> This because in [2016](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) a 2-year increase was 2.0% and 1-year increase was 0.0%, and the difference is 2-year (2.00%) - 1-year (0.00%) = 2.00%.

With the [Rent Act of 2015,](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rent-act-of-2015.page) if a prior tenant was paying a preferential rent, the vacancy lease rent increase that a landlord can collect will be limited.

|**Last Vacancy Lease Commenced**:| **Allowable Vacancy Increase**|
|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|Less than 2 years ago            |        5%                     |
|Less than 3 years ago            |        10%                    |
|Less than 4 years ago            |        15%                    |
|4 or more years ago              |        20%                    |

**Rent Adjustments Calculations**
The Rent Guidelines Board determines the allowable rent adjustment every year. They meet throughout the year, review the latest research, and hear public testimony before [they make their final decision.](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/rent-guidelines/explanation-of-rent-guidelines-process.page) The members of the board are appointed by the mayor for specific terms and are representative of tenant, landlord, and industry interests. A [history of allowable rent increases through 2018](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/rentguidelinesboard/pdf/guidelines/aptorders2018.pdf) can be found online.
