# 22 Tenant's Acknowledgement of Receipt of Lease Rider
_The tenant must sign to acknowledge receipt of the lease rider._

The landlord is obligated to provide the tenant this lease rider at the same time that they either sign the vacancy (original) lease or the renewal lease. This is proof of that the lease was received by the tenant.
