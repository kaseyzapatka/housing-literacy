# 3 Prior Unit Status
*Here, the landlord must clarify the status of the unit prior to offering the [vacancy lease](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/rent-guidelines/vacancy-leases.page) to the current tenant.*

In this rider, the landlord must indicate the status of the unit prior to when the current tenant moved in. Box A is on page 1 and Boxes B, C, and D are all on page 3.

- **Box A:** If the unit was rent-stabilized when the last tenant moved out.

- **Box B:** If the unit was rent-controlled when the last tenant moved out.

- **Box C:** If the unit is subject to some other government program that specifies the rent.

- **Box D:** If the unit has been renovated or altered in some way as to affect the rent that can be charged.


#### Box A
This box will be marked if the unit was rent-stabilized when the last tenant moved out. If this box is marked, the landlord should fill out the relevant information detailing how the rent has been calculated.

**Additional Adjustments to Know About.** If the rent-stabilized unit has been vacant for a prolonged period (generally more than 4 years ago) or the size of the unit was altered, then landlord may be entitled to additional charges beyond the standard, yearly Rent Guideline Board approved increases. See [page 2 of Fact Sheet #5](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac5.pdf) for more information on this.

If the owner did not collect a permanent vacancy increase within eight years of a new vacancy lease then, then the owner is entitled to collect an increase in addition to the standard, yearly increase approved by the Rent Guidelines Board. This additional increase is calculated by multiplying 0.6 times the number of years since the last vacancy increase.

**Example**
> Mr. Hendrix paid a vacancy increase upon moving in, lived in the unit for 10 years and most recently paid a legal rent of $800.00 per month. Ms. King moves into the unit and signs a two- year lease. Then landlord is allowed to collect what’s called a vacancy rent—the first rent collected from a new tenant after a vacancy—from Ms. King of $1,008.00 per month, calculated as follows:
> 		
> 			$800.00 (previous legal regulated rent) + $160.00 ($800 x 20%) + $48.00 ($800.00 x .6% x 10 years) = $1008.00
- 	The $800.00 was the legal previous rent.
- 		The landlord was allowed to collect a vacancy increase of up to 20 percent because it was a 2-year lease the new tenant was entering into, which is why the landlord could add $160.00 ($800 x 20%).
- 		And finally, the landlord was allowed to collect $48.00 more dollars because it has been 10 years since the landlord had collected a vacancy rent ($800.00 x .6% x 10 years).
See [Fact Sheet #26](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac26.pdf) for more details on additional rent increases and how they are calculated.

#### Box B
If the unit was formerly rent-controlled, the unit now becomes rent-stabilized. However, the initial rent determined for that unit is initially a “fair market rent” for that neighborhood, to which the landlord and the tenant agree. After that rent has been raised to a “fair market rent,” the landlord can then only increase the rent in accordance with rent-regulation laws (i.e., IAI, MCIs, and Rent Guideline Board Increases). If the tenant feels that the rent being charged is not a “fair market rent,” they may appeal to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). Tenants using the “Fair Market Appeal Form,” or contact the DHCR’s Office of Rent Administration at (718) 739-6400.

One important note: If a unit was previously rent-controlled and the rent charged to the next tenant is at or above the Deregulation Rent Threshold, the unit can be deregulated. So, a unit can move from being rent-controlled to completely deregulated. Here again, the tenant moving in could challenge the deregulation by filing a [“Fair Market Appeal”](http://www.nyshcr.org/Forms/Rent/ra89FMRA.pdf) with the DHCR.

For more information on “Fair Market Appeals,” see [Fact Sheet #6](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac6.pdf).

#### Box C
This box will be marked if the unit is covered by a specific government program that alters the amount of rent that will be collected or that the renter will pay. Some examples might include, Section-8, Mitchell-Lama, and other types of affordable housing. See the [Rent Guidelines Board’s website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/housing-types.page) for a more detailed explanation of the various types of housing. Make sure that the program and the amount are both specified correctly.

#### Box D
Generally, this box will be marked if the rent has been altered for some other reason. One example of this might be after renovation when the unit’s size has been dramatically altered; in some cases, the landlord might be able to negotiate a free-market rent, which is a rent for a unit that is agreed upon by the tenant and the landlord and for which the increases are not controlled by the Rent Guidelines Board.  See the [Rent Guidelines Board’s website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/housing-types.page) for a more detailed explanation of Private Market (Unregulated).ÂÂ
