# 11 Rent Increase Exemptions
There are two populations that may be exempt from rent increases. Tenants who live in a rent-regulated unit (for example, rent controlled, rent stabilized, Mitchell-Lama) and are either senior citizens (62 years or older) or disabled (anyone 18 years or older) may be granted certain exemptions from rent increases. There are some eligibility requirement, for example, a senior citizen applying for a rent freeze must have a household income less than $50,000.

Tenants can determine whether they qualify for a **Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE)** or a **Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE)** by calling 311 and following the menu options.  [This website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentfreeze/qualifications/qualifications.page) briefly outlines the qualifications for each program, and [this website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentfreeze/tools/rent-freeze-qualifier-tool.page) helps determine eligibility.

**_Special Note for Tenants with preferential rents:_** If you have a preferential rent—a rent is below the legal allowable rent that a landlord can charge—you may still be eligible to apply. However, rents  will not necessarily be frozen at the preferential level. Tenants should speak to someone about their eligibility. [Applications](http://nyc.gov/rentfreeze) can be found online.
