# 17 A Right to Privacy
Tenants have a right to privacy in their apartments. However, under certain conditions, the landlord has the right to enter the apartment to make repairs, improvements, or to inspect the unit to make sure it is incompliance with the Housing Maintenance Code, **as long as they give reasonable notice,** do so during a reasonable hour, and have the tenant's consent. If the tenant unreasonably denies entry into the apartment, the landlord can seek a court order that will permit entry. In case of emergency, such as a fire, water leak, or life-threatening emergency, the landlord may enter without prior consent or notice.
