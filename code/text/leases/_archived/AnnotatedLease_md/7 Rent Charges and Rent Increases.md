# 7 Rent Charges and Rent Increases
**Non Rent-Regulated Units.** For units that are not rent-regulated, the landlord can only charge as much as the tenant is willing to pay. The amount is negotiated with every lease renewal.

**Rent-Regulated Units.** One of the benefits of living in a rent-regulated unit is that the initial rent and any rent increases on renewal leases are set by rent regulation laws decided every year by the Rent Guidelines Board. In rent-regulated units, there are a few ways that the landlord can raise rents.

- The Rent Guidelines Board
- Vacancy Rental Increases
- MCI and IAI’s
- Extremely low rents

**Rent Guidelines Board.** The landlord is only able to charge up to the amount set by the Rent Guidelines Board, which meets late each summer to decide rates for the coming year.

**Vacancy Rental Increases.** When the landlord is signing a new lease with a new tenant, they are entitled to a certain percentage increase on the rent. This percentage varies from between 16 percent to 20 percent depending on the year and the length of the lease. See [Fact Sheet #26](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac26.pdf) for more on this.

**MCI and IAI’s.** Another way that landlords can increase rents is if there is a Major Capital Improvement (MCI) or Individual Apartment Improvement (IAI). MCI’s are improvements made that affect the entire building and requires DHCR approval, while IAI’s are improvements to only specific apartments and do not require approval unless the unit is occupied, in which case the tenant has to consent by written document.  The landlord is allowed to add either 1/40th or 1/60th of the cost of the improvement, depending the type of improvement. For more information concerning IAIs, see [Fact Sheet #12](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/OperationalBulletins/orao20161.pdf) or [Fact Sheet #24](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac24.pdf) concerning MCIs.

**Extremely low rents.** If certain cases, where the rent is very low (usually between $300 and $500) the landlord is entitled to collect an addition increase in rent beyond allowable legal rental increases or vacancy increases. For more information see Fact [Fact Sheet #26](http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/FactSheets/orafac26.pdf).

**Challenging Rental Increases.** Additionally, tenants have the right to challenge rent increases that they believe to be unfair up to four years after the increase went into effect. For more information, see [pages 6 and 7 of the Tenants’ Rights Guide](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf).
