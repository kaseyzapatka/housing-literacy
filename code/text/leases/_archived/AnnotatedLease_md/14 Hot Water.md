# 14 Hot Water
The landlord must provide tenants with hot and cold water at all times, 365 days out of the year. Hot water must register at a temperature of **120 degrees Fahrenheit at the tap.** If the utilities are equipped with an anti-scalding device, which prevents tenants from burning themselves, the minimum temperature at the tap must be 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
