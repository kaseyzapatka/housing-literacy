# 8 Rent History
As a rent stabilized tenant, you are entitled to know your rent history. You can access this information in several ways:

1.	fill out the [Online Contact Form](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask)
2.	calling the Rent Info Hotline
3.	visiting your Borough or district office in person
4.	requesting your records via mail

The [Tenant Protection Unit's](http://www.nyshcr.org/rent/tenantresources.htm) website outlines how to access these records and what you will need to do so. Filling out the online contact form is the easiest method.

You can also use the [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) website to see if your building has been listed as having filed records about rent regulation in the years since 1984. This method, however, is less reliable and only lists the building, not the unit that is under rent regulation. It is important to remember that not every unit in a building is necessarily rent-regulated.


The Division of Housing and Community Renewal keeps a [list of all the buildings](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/rentguidelinesboard/resources/rent-stabilized-building-lists.page) that have registered in the past for the rent-stabilization program. However, they do very little to verify the accuracy of these registrations. So, it is possible that your buildingâ€™s units are no longer on their list.

A civic hacker has setup [a website](http://blog.johnkrauss.com/where-is-decontrol/) that allows users to look at the changes in the number of rent-stabilized units across the City from 2007 to 2014. He updated those number in 2016 and has a blog piece about how he obtained those data.
