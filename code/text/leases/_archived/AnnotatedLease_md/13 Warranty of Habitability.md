# 13 Warranty of Habitability
The warrant of habitability is a basic tenant right that ensures tenants have a safe, sanitary, and livable apartment. It is implied in any written and even in any oral agreement. Any lease that waves this right is void because it is not a right that can be waived. 

**Examples of a breach of a warranty of habitability** include a failure of the landlord to clear an apartment of an insect infestation or a failure to provide heat or hot water on a regular basis. If the inhabitable condition is a result of the actions of the tenant or one of their guests, this does not constitute a breach of the warranty of habitability and it is the tenant's responsibility to remedy the condition.
