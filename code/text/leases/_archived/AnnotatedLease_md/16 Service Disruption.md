# 16 Service Disruption
The landlord must continually provide heat (during heating season) and hot water (all year). If a landlord fails to pay for either, the utility company must notify tenants and certain government agencies in writing before they stop utility service. The tenant has the right to pay the utility bills directly, in which case the utility service cannot be stopped. 

The same applies for buildings that are oil-heated. If the landlord fails to pay the oil supplier, the tenant can contract directly with an oil supplier to ensure ample oil supply. Any payments made directly to an oil supplier or a utility company can be deducted from the rent.  

Other service reductions can happen. For example, if the garbage is not being taken out, the elevator does not work, or the tenant is having problems with utilities like the oven, refrigerator, or the toilet. In these cases, tenants are encouraged to take specific actions: 

1.	They should contact the owner. If the owner does not respond, contacting them in writing is encouraged, but no longer required for your case to be heard by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).

2.	The tenant is then encouraged to file an official complaint with DHCR, within 10 days of altering their owner. If the complaint involves just their unit, they should file an "Application For A Rent Reduction Based Upon Decreased Services - Individual Apartment.” If the complaint involves the entire building they should file an "Application For A Rent Reduction Based Upon Decreased Building-Wide Services.” A copy of the complaint should be sent to their owner (or their agent) as well. If the problem persists, they could be eligible for a reduction in rent.

3.	Depending on the type of complaint, the owner will be notified with a timeline to which they must address the complaint. The owner can file a response, which will be sent to the tenant and the tenant will have a specified time to respond. The DHCR can schedule an inspection during the process. 

4.	 If the evidence suggests that the landlord has failed to comply, the DHCR can order the landlord to comply and reduce the rent for the unit until the issue has been addressed. If the landlord has failed to comply with the order within 30 days of the issue of the order, the tenant can file a Tenant Affirmation of Non-Compliance,” and is authorized to reduce the rent according to DHCR specifications.

5.	When the issue has been addressed, the landlord will receive a Rent Restoration Order, which will restore the rent to the previous level.

If the tenant fails to grant the landlord or their agent entry to the unit, the complaint can be denied.
