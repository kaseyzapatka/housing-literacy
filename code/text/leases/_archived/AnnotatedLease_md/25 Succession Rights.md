# 25 Succession Rights
Generally, for rent-regulated units (rent-stabilized, rent-controlled, and Mitchel-Lama), family members living with the primary resident (the tenant that is named on the lease) have a legal right to succeed the primary resident on the lease if that tenant dies or vacates the unit. 

A **family member** is defined as a spouse, children or stepchildren, brothers and sisters, parents and step-parents, grandparents and grandchildren, as well as in-laws. Family member status can also be extended to someone who can prove they provide emotional and financial support to the tenant and establish interdependence (that they and the tenant depend on each other). Some examples of interdependence are:

- being in a long relationship 
- sharing of or relying upon each other for housing costs, family expenses, and/or other common necessities of life
- intermingling of finances like having a joint bank account or owning property together, sharing credit cards or loan obligations, or receiving government benefit
- engaging in family-type activities by jointly attending family functions, holidays and celebrations, social and recreational activities 

There are some minimum residency requirements, however. The rights of succession will not be granted to the family member if they have not continually lived with the primary resident continually for at least two years (one year in the case of disabled persons or senior citizens). Exceptions are made if the family member's tenure is broken by military service, they are enrolled as a full-time student, or if they are hospitalized, for example.
