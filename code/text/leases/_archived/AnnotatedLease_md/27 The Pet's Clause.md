# 27 The Pet's Clause
Tenants may keep pets in their unit unless other specified against doing so in their lease. Landlords can evict tenants who violate their lease by having a pet if the lease specifies that they cannot.

However, in New York City and Westchester County, the no-pet clause is waived if it can be demonstrated that another tenant has "openly and notoriously" kept a pet to the landlord or their agent's knowledge for more than three months. Some examples of other tenants keeping pets would be if they were talking their dog for a walk, or the super entering the apartment and seeing the pet or evidence of a pet like a lease or a litter box. Additionally, tenants who may have disabilities may also ask for service animals or emotional support animals.
