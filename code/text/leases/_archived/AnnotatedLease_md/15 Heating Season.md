# 15 Heating Season
There are specific requirements as to when the landlord must provide heating services. 

Between **October 1 and May 31,** if between 6am and 10pm the outside temperature falls below **55 degrees Fahrenheit** the temperature inside the apartment must be 68 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Between October 1 and May 31, if between 10pm and 6am **regardless of the temperature outside,** the unit must be heated to at **least 62 degrees Fahrenheit.**

If the tenant is paying for their own heating, they have the right to request a summary of the landlord's past two years of bill payment for heating. This, however, is very rare in NYC.
