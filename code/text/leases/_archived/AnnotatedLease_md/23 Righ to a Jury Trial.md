# 23 Right to a Jury Trial 	
This section in the lease waives the right to a jury trial for either party in legal disputes related to this lease. In other words, both parties waive the right to a jury trial if there is a dispute over sections of this lease. Specifically, this means that any dispute about elements of this lease will be heard and decided by a judge, in what is called a bench trial.

This does not, however, waive the rights to a jury trial for a lawsuit brought by either the landlord or the tenant for matters regarding personal injury or property damage. Any lease that waives these rights is void, that means unenforceable and not legally binding.
