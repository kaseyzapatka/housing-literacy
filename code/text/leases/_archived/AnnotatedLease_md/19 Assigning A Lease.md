# 19 Assigning A Lease
The **primary resident** (the tenant whose name is on the lease) assigns the lease to another when they are transfer the entire interest of the unit to someone else and permanently vacate the premises. This means they will have no future rights, interests, or claims to the unit. Essentially, they are giving up the apartment.

This can only be done with the written consent of the landlord, who may refuse for any reason or no reason at all. If the landlord's refusal is found to be unreasonable, the tenant is entitled to be released within 30 days of the date from which the request was originally submitted to the landlord.
