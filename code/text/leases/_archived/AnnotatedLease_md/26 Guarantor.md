# 26 Guarantor
A **guarantor** is someone who pledges their assets or services if the original lease signer defaults on a rent payment. In other words, they serve as a co-signer on the lease. This is done as an added layer of security for the landlord, and is a fairly common practice. If the original renter misses a payment, the landlord has the legal right to pursue payment from the guarantor instead. 

A guarantor is usually requested by a landlord when the income (or combined income in the case of multiple people on the lease) is less than 40-45 times the monthly rent. 

**Example**
> If the monthly rent for a two-bedroom unit is $1,500, then the combined income or the two tenants appearing on the lease must be between $60,000 and $67,500, depending on which multiplier is used. If there is only one tenant on the lease, the tenant's income would need to be between $60,000 and $67,500.
