# 12 Security Deposits
It is common for a landlord to require a security deposit, due at lease signing that is equal to one month's rent. If there is an allowable rent increase on a lease renewal, the landlord is entitled to collect additional money from the tenant that equals the increase. The money that will be collected is the difference in what of what has already been collected and what the new rent will be. So, for example, if rent went up from $1,500 to $1,550 a month, the landlord can collect $50 more dollars at the lease renewal signing to cover the new security deposit.

**Security deposits** are treated as a trust funds belonging to the tenants. This means they should be deposited into a bank account that is separate from the landlord's bank account or personal money. The landlord is entitled up to 1 percent of any interest that is earned on the security deposit to cover administrative fees. The rest is owed to the tenant, however, in recent years the interest hasn’t yielded more than 1%. 

**_Example_** 

> A security deposit of $1,000 is deposited into a bank that will pay an interest rate of 1.5%. After one year, the security deposit will have generated $15.00 from interest. The landlord is entitled to keep $10.00 (1 % of the deposit) as an administrative fee and the remaining $5.00 goes to the tenant. However, the landlord is entitled to keep the security deposit to pay for reasonable costs of repairs beyond normal wear and tear. 

The tenant has the right to receive their share of the interest earned on the security deposit annually, at the end of each lease term, or it can be applied to rent. 

If a rent stabilized building is sold, the landlord must either transfer the security deposits to the new landlord or return the security deposits to the tenant 5 days after the sale. However, the responsibility falls on the purchaser to return the security deposit regardless if the security deposit has been received or returned to the new landlord.
