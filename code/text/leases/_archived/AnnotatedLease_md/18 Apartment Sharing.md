# 18 Apartment Sharing
The tenant has the right to share the unit with immediate family, one additional occupant, and that occupant's dependent children. However, the prime tenant (the tenant’s whose name is on the lease) or their spouse must occupy the unit as their primary residence.

Tenants who sublet a room or have roommates cannot charge more than the rent they are paying to the landlord and those roommates who are not on the lease cannot take over the lease. Further, tenants are not allowed to charge more than their proportional share of the rent, which refers to the amount of rent that is owed based on the number of rooms in a unit.

**Example**
> In a two-bedroom apartment that rents for $1,000, the tenant is not allowed to charge the other roommate or the subtenant more than $500, that is, each tenant or subtenant is responsible for 50 percent of the rent because there are two tenants and two rooms. In the same apartment, a tenant charging a roommate or a subtenant $650, would be charging them more than their proportional share of the rent. This is to discourage short-term subletting arrangements and is usually only enforced in Airbnb style arrangements.

Usually new roommates that were not on the original lease are not added to an existing lease. When the prime tenant leaves, the landlord can offer the roommate a new lease, but there is usually a vacancy increase in the rent.

In the case where the lease names more than one tenant, these tenants may share the unit with their immediate families. If one tenant moves out, he or she may be replaced with another occupant and their children. At least one of the tenants named on the lease or their spouse must use the unit as their primary residence.

However, landlords have the right to limit the total number of people living in the unit to comply with legal overcrowding standards. This is generally used as a way for landlords to prevent tenants from abusing this right or living in overcrowded (and therefore dangerous) living arrangements.

**Short-term Sublets (Airbnb style arrangements)**
While it is common for people to rent out their _entire_ apartment for less than 30 days, this is illegal according to recent amendments to the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law:

> [2010 Amendment to Article 1 of the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/local_laws/NYS_chapter_225.pdf)
>
> [2016 Amendment to Article 1 of the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/S6340)

### However, this is only illegal if it you are renting out the entire unit, that is, as long as one of the primary tenants lives in the unit and does not charge more than the proportional share of the rent.
