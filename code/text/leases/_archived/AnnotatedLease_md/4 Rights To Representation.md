# 4 Rights To Representation
In the late summer of 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed into law Intro 214, which guarantees tenants access to justice if they are facing an eviction in housing court. Some people have called this law the right to counsel, but this law only provides access to legal counsel in initial cases and the city will only pay legal fees for the initial case. If there is an appeal or your case requires further legal attention, the City may not help pay for legal counsel. Moreover, this only applies to individuals who live in a few specific zip codes of New York City (the program is intended to expand to all of New York by 2022) and they are making less than 200% of the federal poverty lineâ€”which means anyone making two times the poverty line or less will be ensured legal representation in housing court. Here is a link to the [2017-2018 Federal Poverty Guidelines](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/wic/income_guidelines.htm), which are effective until **June 2018**.

How this will all work is still being figured out. Both of the following organizations have a bit more information on this.
